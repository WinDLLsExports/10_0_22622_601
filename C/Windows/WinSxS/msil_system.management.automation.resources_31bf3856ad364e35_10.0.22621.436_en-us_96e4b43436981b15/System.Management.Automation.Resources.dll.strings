Disabling the session configurations does not undo all the changes made by the Enable-PSRemoting or Enable-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet. You might have to manually undo the changes by following these steps:
    1. Stop and disable the WinRM service.
    2. Delete the listener that accepts requests on any IP address.
    3. Disable the firewall exceptions for WS-Management communications.
    4. Restore the value of the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy to 0, which restricts remote access to members of the Administrators group on the computer.

3MatchType must be 'Command', 'Error', or 'Dynamic'.
3Rule must be a ScriptBlock for dynamic match types.
The command {0} was not found, but does exist in the current location. Windows PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: "{1}". See "get-help about_Command_Precedence" for more details.
{Once a transaction is started, only commands that get called with the -UseTransaction flag become part of that transaction.
The Use-Transaction cmdlet is intended for scripting of transaction-enabled .NET objects. Its ScriptBlock should contain nothing else.t

+The alias "{0}" is declared multiple times.
Cannot resolve alias '{0}' because it refers to term '{1}', which is not recognized as a cmdlet, function, operable program, or script file. Verify the term and try again.
~The argument '{0}' is not recognized as a cmdlet, possibly because it does not derive from the Cmdlet or PSCmdlet classes: {1}
The cmdlet name "{0}" cannot be validated because it is not in the correct format. Cmdlet names must include a verb and a noun separated by a "-", such as "Get-Process".
1Argument '{0}' is not recognized as a cmdlet: {1}
The command could not be retrieved because the ArgumentList parameter can be specified only when retrieving a single cmdlet or script.
0Cannot retrieve an instance of CommandDiscovery.
Parameter '{0}' with value '{1}' cannot be processed because it is not a cmdlet and cannot be processed by the CommandProcessor.
The term '{0}' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
tNo matching commands include a parameter named '{0}'.  Check the spelling of the parameter name, and then try again.
ZParameter could not be declared. Parameters can be declared only on fields and properties.
The '{0}' command was found in the module '{1}', but the module could not be loaded. For more information, run 'Import-Module {1}'.
TThe module '{0}' could not be loaded. For more information, run 'Import-Module {0}'.
Cannot dot-source this command because it was defined in a different language mode. To invoke this command without importing its contents, omit the '.' operator.
JAn assembly named '{0}' already exists. Assemblies must have unique names.
DA cmdlet named '{0}' already exists. Cmdlets must have unique names.
VA cmdlet provider named '{0}' already exists. Cmdlet providers must have unique names.
DA script named '{0}' already exists. Scripts must have unique names.
%An ExecutionContext has not been set.
GThe ShowCommandInfo and Syntax parameters cannot be specified together.
_Cannot process the cmdlet. A cmdlet name must consist of a verb and noun pair separated by '-'.
{0} (Version {1})
FThe parameter "{0}" is declared in parameter-set "{1}" multiple times.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contains a "#requires" statement for running as Administrator. The current Windows PowerShell session is not running as Administrator. Start Windows PowerShell by  using the Run as Administrator option, and then try running the script again.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement with a shell ID of {1} that is incompatible with the current shell. To run this script you must use the shell located at '{2}'.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement with a shell ID of {1} that is incompatible with the current shell.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because the following modules that are specified by the "#requires" statements of the script are missing: {1}.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because the following snap-ins that are specified by the "#requires" statements of the script are missing: {1}.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement for PowerShell editions '{1}'. The edition of PowerShell that is required by the script does not match the currently running PowerShell {2} edition.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement for Windows PowerShell {1}. The version of Windows PowerShell that is required by the script does not match the currently running version of Windows PowerShell {2}.
A #requires statement has specified only a shellID. #Requires statements must specify a required Windows PowerShell snap-in when running in Windows PowerShell.
4The parameter name "{0}" is reserved for future use.

 csharpIdentifierRegex based on C# Language Specification 3.0, section 2.4.2 Idenfifiers
 - the C# spec allows \p{Pc}\p{Cf}\p{Mn}\{Mc} in csharpIdentifierOtherCharacterRegex, 
   but those characters classes seem risky wrt code injection attacks, so they were
   removed above.  
   - '_' (ASCII 95) is the only character in \p{Pc} class out of the first 0..255 characters
   - No characters in the first 0..255 characters belong to \p{Cf}, \p{Mn}, \p{Mc}
