Cannot execute the pipeline because the first cmdlet in the pipeline is trying to read input from a previous cmdlet. Either modify the first cmdlet, remove the first cmdlet, or add the cmdlet whose output is needed by the first cmdlet, then execute the pipeline again.
Cannot process the cmdlet number. The ReadFromCommand function must specify the Id of a cmdlet that has already been added to the pipeline. Please contact Microsoft Support Services.
Cannot read the output specified by the ReadFromCommand and ReadErrorQueue functions because another cmdlet is already reading that output. Please contact Microsoft Support Services.
uCannot execute pipeline because there are no commands. Add at least one command to the pipeline and execute it again.

TerminatingError({0}): "{1}"
Cannot complete pipeline execution because it hasn't been started yet. You must call the Begin() method before calling End() on a steppable pipeline.
A cmdlet threw an exception after calling ThrowTerminatingError.
The first exception was "{0}" with stack trace "{1}".
The second exception was "{2}" with stack trace "{3}". Determine why these exception were thrown and try again.
The WriteObject and WriteError methods cannot be called from outside the overrides of the BeginProcessing, ProcessRecord, and EndProcessing methods, and only from that same thread. Validate that the cmdlet makes these calls correctly, or please contact Microsoft Support Services.
The WriteObject and WriteError methods cannot be called after the pipeline has been closed. Please contact Microsoft Support Services.

The number of supplied arguments ({1}) is less than the minimum number of allowed arguments ({0}). Specify more than {0} arguments and then try the command again.
The ValidateCount attribute cannot be applied to a non-array parameter. Either remove the attribute from the parameter or make the parameter an array parameter.
""{0}" failed on property "{1}" {2}
The argument length of {1} is too long. Shorten the length of the argument to less than or equal to "{0}" and then try the command again.
The specified maximum argument length is smaller than the specified minimum argument length. Update the ValidateLength attribute for the parameter.
The number of characters ({1}) in the argument is too small. Specify an argument whose length is greater than or equal to "{0}" and then try the command again.
The ValidateLength attribute cannot be applied to a parameter that is not a string or string[] parameter. Make the parameter a string or string[] parameter.
The argument is null, or an element of the argument collection contains a null value. Supply a collection that does not contain any null values and then try the command again.
KThe argument is null. Supply a non-null argument and try the command again.
The argument is null, empty, or an element of the argument collection contains a null value. Supply a collection that does not contain any null values and then try the command again.
kThe argument is null or empty. Supply an argument that is not null or empty and then try the command again.
uThe argument "{0}" does not match the "{1}" pattern. Supply an argument that matches "{1}" and try the command again.
The argument cannot be validated because its type "{0}" is not the same type ({1}) as the maximum and minimum limits of the parameter. Make sure the argument is of type {1} and then try the command again.
The {0} argument is greater than the maximum allowed range of {1}. Supply an argument that is less than {1} and then try the command again.
The specified maximum range cannot be accepted because it is less than the specified minimum range. Update the ValidateRange attribute for the parameter.
The specified minimum range ({0}) cannot be accepted because it is not the same type as the specified maximum range ({1}). Update the ValidateRange attribute for the parameter.
}Cannot accept the MaxRange and MinRange parameter type. Both parameters must be objects that implement IComparable interface.
The {0} argument is less than the minimum allowed range of {1}. Supply an argument that is greater than {1} and then try the command again.
The "{1}" validation script for the argument with value "{0}" did not return true. Determine why the validation script failed and then try the command again.
The argument "{0}" does not belong to the set "{1}" specified by the ValidateSet attribute. Supply an argument that is in the set and then try the command again.
GCannot validate argument '{0}' because it is not a valid variable name.
The "{0}" argument does not contain a valid Windows PowerShell version. Supply a valid version number and then try the command again.

+The alias "{0}" is declared multiple times.
Cannot resolve alias '{0}' because it refers to term '{1}', which is not recognized as a cmdlet, function, operable program, or script file. Verify the term and try again.
~The argument '{0}' is not recognized as a cmdlet, possibly because it does not derive from the Cmdlet or PSCmdlet classes: {1}
The cmdlet name "{0}" cannot be validated because it is not in the correct format. Cmdlet names must include a verb and a noun separated by a "-", such as "Get-Process".
YThe term '{0}' resolved to a cmdlet name that is ambiguous. Possible matches include:{1}.
1Argument '{0}' is not recognized as a cmdlet: {1}
The command could not be retrieved because the ArgumentList parameter can be specified only when retrieving a single cmdlet or script.
0Cannot retrieve an instance of CommandDiscovery.
Parameter '{0}' with value '{1}' cannot be processed because it is not a cmdlet and cannot be processed by the CommandProcessor.
The term '{0}' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
ZParameter could not be declared. Parameters can be declared only on fields and properties.
R'{0}' already exists as an assembly. Only one assembly can exist for a given name.
M'{0}' already exists as a cmdlet. Only one cmdlet can exist for a given name.
_'{0}' already exists as a cmdlet Provider. Only one cmdlet Provider can exist for a given name.
M'{0}' already exists as a script. Only one script can exist for a given name.
%An ExecutionContext has not been set.
_Cannot process the cmdlet. A cmdlet name must consist of a verb and noun pair separated by '-'.
{0} (Version {1})
FThe parameter "{0}" is declared in parameter-set "{1}" multiple times.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement at line {1} with a shell ID of {2} that is incompatible with the current shell. To run this script you must use the shell located at '{3}'.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement at line {1} with a shell ID of {2} that is incompatible with the current shell.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because the following snap-ins that are specified by the "#requires" statements of the script are missing: {1}.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement at line {1} for Windows PowerShell version {2}. The version required by the script does not match the currently running version of Windows PowerShell version {3}.
#Requires has specified only a shellID. #Requires needs to specify a required Windows PowerShell snap-in when running in Windows PowerShell.
4The parameter name "{0}" is reserved for future use.
dCannot process the "#requires" statement at line {0} because the argument to parameter {1} is empty.
Cannot process the "#requires" statement at line {0} because it is not in the correct format.
The "#requires" statement must be in one of the following formats:
 "#requires -shellid <shellID>"
 "#requires -version <major.minor>"
 "#requires -pssnapin <psSnapInName> [-version <major.minor>]"
Cannot process the "#requires" statement at line {0} because the Windows PowerShell snap-in name '{1}' can only have alpha-numeric, dash, underscore or period characters.
Cannot process the "#requires" statement at line {0} because the value of argument {1} is invalid. Specify a valid Windows PowerShell version of the format major.minor version.
jCannot process the "#requires" statement at line {0} because a closing quote is missing from argument {1}.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement for which there was no valid registration in the Windows Registry for the specified shell ID '{1}'.
