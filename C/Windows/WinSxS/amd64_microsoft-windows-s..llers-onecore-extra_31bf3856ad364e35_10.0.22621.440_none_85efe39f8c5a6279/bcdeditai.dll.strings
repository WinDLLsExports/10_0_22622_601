BCDEDIT - Boot Configuration Data Store Editor
The Bcdedit.exe command-line tool modifies the boot configuration data store.
The boot configuration data store contains boot configuration parameters and
controls how the operating system is booted. These parameters were previously
in the Boot.ini file (in BIOS-based operating systems) or in the nonvolatile
RAM entries (in Extensible Firmware Interface-based operating systems). You can
use Bcdedit.exe to add, delete, edit, and append entries in the boot
configuration data store.
For detailed command and option information, type bcdedit.exe /? <command>. For
example, to display detailed information about the /createstore command, type:
     bcdedit.exe /? /createstore
For an alphabetical list of topics in this help file, run "bcdedit /? TOPICS".
Commands that operate on a store
================================
/store          Used to specify a BCD store other than the current system default.
/createstore    Creates a new and empty boot configuration data store.
/export         Exports the contents of the system store to a file. This file
                can be used later to restore the state of the system store.
/import         Restores the state of the system store using a backup file
                created with the /export command.
/sysstore       Sets the system store device (only affects EFI systems, does
                not persist across reboots, and is only used in cases where
                the system store device is ambiguous).
Commands that operate on entries in a store
===========================================
/copy           Makes copies of entries in the store.
/create         Creates new entries in the store.
/delete         Deletes entries from the store.
/mirror         Creates mirror of entries in the store.
Run bcdedit /? ID for information about identifiers used by these commands.
Commands that operate on entry options
======================================
/deletevalue    Deletes entry options from the store.
/set            Sets entry option values in the store.
Run bcdedit /? TYPES for a list of datatypes used by these commands.
Run bcdedit /? FORMATS for a list of valid data formats.
Commands that control output
============================
/enum           Lists entries in the store.
/v              Command-line option that displays entry identifiers in full,
                rather than using names for well-known identifiers.
                Use /v by itself as a command to display entry identifiers
                in full for the ACTIVE type.
Running "bcdedit" by itself is equivalent to running "bcdedit /enum ACTIVE".
Commands that control the boot manager
======================================
/bootsequence   Sets the one-time boot sequence for the boot manager.
/default        Sets the default entry that the boot manager will use.
/displayorder   Sets the order in which the boot manager displays the
                multiboot menu.
/timeout        Sets the boot manager time-out value.
/toolsdisplayorder  Sets the order in which the boot manager displays
                    the tools menu.
Commands that control Emergency Management Services for a boot application
==========================================================================
/bootems        Enables or disables Emergency Management Services
                for a boot application.
/ems            Enables or disables Emergency Management Services for an
                operating system entry.
/emssettings    Sets the global Emergency Management Services parameters.
Command that control debugging
==============================
/bootdebug      Enables or disables boot debugging for a boot application.
/dbgsettings    Sets the global debugger parameters.
/debug          Enables or disables kernel debugging for an operating system
                entry.
/hypervisorsettings  Sets the hypervisor parameters.
Command that control remote event logging
=========================================
/eventsettings  Sets the global remote event logging parameters.
/event          Enables or disables remote event logging for an operating
                system entry.
This command lists entries in a store. The /enum command is the default,
so running "bcdedit" without parameters is equivalent to running
"bcdedit /enum ACTIVE".
bcdedit [/store <filename>] /enum [<type> | <id>] [/v]
    <filename>  Specifies the store to be used. If this option is not
                specified, the system store is used. For more information,
                run "bcdedit /? store".
    <type>      Specifies the type of entries to be listed. <type> can be one
                of the following:
                ACTIVE      All entries in the boot manager display order. This
                            is the default.
                FIRMWARE    All firmware applications.
                BOOTAPP     All boot environment applications.
                BOOTMGR     The boot manager.
                OSLOADER    All operating system entries.
                RESUME      All resume from hibernation entries.
                INHERIT     All inherit entries.
                ALL         All entries.
    <id>        Specifies the identifier of the entry to be listed.  If an
                identifier is provided, then only the specified object will be
                listed. For information about identifiers, run "bcdedit /? ID".
    /v          Displays entry identifiers in full, rather than using
                names for well-known identifiers.
Examples:
The following command lists all operating system loader boot entries:
    bcdedit /enum OSLOADER
The following command lists all boot manager entries:
    bcdedit /enum BOOTMGR
The following command lists only the default boot entry:
    bcdedit /enum {default}
The following command lists only the specified operating system boot entry:
    bcdedit /enum {b38a9fc1-5690-11da-b795-e9ad3c5e0e3a}
This command creates a new entry in the boot configuration data store. If
a well-known identifier is specified, then the /application, /inherit and
/device options cannot be specified. If the <id> is not specified,
or if <id>is not well-known, then you must specify an /application, /inherit
or /device option.
bcdedit /create [{<id>}] [/d <description>] [/application <apptype> |
    /inherit [<apptype>] | /inherit DEVICE | /device]
    <id>                    Specifies the identifier to be used for the new
                            entry. For more information about identifiers, run
                            "bcdedit /? ID".
    <description>           Specifies the description to be applied to the new
                            entry.
    /application <apptype>  Specifies that the new entry must be an application
                            entry. <apptype> specifies the application type.
                            <apptype> can be one of the following:
                                BOOTAPP
                                BOOTSECTOR
                                OSLOADER
                                RESUME
                                STARTUP
                            If you use other application types instead of
                            one of these, you must also specify a well-known
                            identifier.
    /inherit [<apptype>]    Specifies that the new entry must be an inherit
                            entry, and <apptype> specifies the application
                            type. If <apptype> is not specified, then the entry
                            can be inherited by any entry. If specified,
                            <apptype> can be one of the following:
                                BOOTMGR
                                BOOTSECTOR
                                FWBOOTMGR
                                MEMDIAG
                                NTLDR
                                OSLOADER
                                RESUME
                            The modifier prevents the inherit entry from being
                            inherited by an application entry of <apptype>.
    /inherit DEVICE         Specifies that the new entry must be an inherit
                            entry, and that the entry can only be inherited by
                            a device options entry.
    /device                 Specifies that the new entry must be an additional
                            device options entry.
Examples:
The following command creates a NTLDR based OS loader entry (Ntldr):
    bcdedit /create {ntldr} /d "Earlier Windows OS Loader"
The following command creates a RAM disk additional options entry:
    bcdedit /create {ramdiskoptions}
The following command creates a new operating system boot entry:
    bcdedit /create /d "Windows Vista" /application osloader
The following command creates a new debugger settings entry:
    bcdedit /create {dbgsettings}
This command creates a copy of the specified boot entry.
bcdedit [/store <filename>] /copy {<id>} /d <description>
    <filename>      Specifies the store to be used. If this option is not
                    specified, the system store is used. For more information,
                    run "bcdedit /? store".
    <id>            Specifies the identifier of the entry to be copied.
                    For more information about identifiers, run
                    "bcdedit /? ID".
    <description>   Specifies the description to be applied to the new entry.
Example:
The following command creates a copy of the specified operating system boot
entry:
    bcdedit /copy {cbd971bf-b7b8-4885-951a-fa03044f5d71} /d "Copy of entry"
This command deletes an entry from the boot configuration data store.
bcdedit [/store <filename>] /delete <id> [/f] [/cleanup | /nocleanup]
    <filename>      Specifies the store to be used. If this option is not
                    specified, the system store is used. For more information,
                    run "bcdedit /? store".
    <id>            Specifies the identifier of the boot entry that you want to
                    delete. For more information about identifiers,
                    run "bcdedit /? ID".
    /f              Deletes the specified entry. Without this option, Bcdedit
                    will not delete any entries that have a well-known
                    identifier.
    /cleanup        Deletes the specified entry and removes the entry from the
                    display order. Any other references to the entry being
                    deleted will also be removed from the store.  When deleting
                    an OS loader entry, the associated resume from hibernation
                    entry is also deleted if it is not referenced by any other
                    OS loaders. This option is assumed unless /nocleanup is
                    specified.
    /nocleanup      Deletes the specified entry without removing the entry from
                    the display order.
Examples:
The following command deletes the specified operating system entry from the
store and removes the entry from the display order:
    bcdedit /delete {cbd971bf-b7b8-4885-951a-fa03044f5d71}
The following command deletes the specified operating system entry from the
store and removes the entry from the display order:
    bcdedit /delete {cbd971bf-b7b8-4885-951a-fa03044f5d71} /cleanup
The following command deletes the specified operating system entry from the
store without removing the entry from the display order:
    bcdedit /delete {cbd971bf-b7b8-4885-951a-fa03044f5d71} /nocleanup
The following command deletes the NTLDR based OS loader entry from the store:
    bcdedit /delete {ntldr} /f
This command sets an entry option value in the boot configuration data store.
bcdedit [/store <filename>] /set [{<id>}] <datatype> <value> [ /addfirst | /addlast | /remove ]
    <filename>  Specifies the store to be used. If this option is not
                specified, the system store is used. For more information,
                run "bcdedit /? store".
    <id>        Specifies the identifier of the entry to be modified.  If not
                specified, {current} is used. For more information about
                identifiers, run "bcdedit /? ID".
    <datatype>  Specifies the option data type that will be created or
                modified. Run "bcdedit /? TYPES" for more information about
                data types.
    <value>     Specifies the value that should be assigned to the option. The
                format of <value> depends on the data type specified. Run
                "bcdedit /? FORMATS" for more information about data formats.
    /addfirst   This switch can only be used if datatype is an object list.
                Adds the specified entry identifier to the top of the list.
                If this switch is specified, only a single entry identifier
                may be specified.  If the specified identifier is already
                in the list, it will be moved to the top of the list.
    /addlast    This switch can only be used if datatype is an object list.
                Adds the specified entry identifier to the end of the list.
                If this switch is specified, only a single entry identifier

                    display order.  At least one identifier must be specified
                    and they must be separated by spaces.  For more information
                    about identifiers, run "bcdedit /? ID".
    /addfirst       Adds the specified entry identifier to the top of
                    the display order.  If this switch is specified, only a
                    single entry identifier may be specified.  If the specified
                    identifier is already in the list, it will be moved to the
                    top of the list.
    /addlast        Adds the specified entry identifier to the end of
                    the display order.  If this switch is specified, only a
                    single entry identifier may be specified.  If the specified
                    identifier is already in the list, it is moved to the
                    end of the list.
    /remove         Removes the specified entry identifier from the
                    display order.  If this switch is specified, only a single
                    entry identifier may be specified.  If the identifier is
                    not in the list then the operation has no effect. If
                    the last entry is being removed, then the display order
                    value is deleted from the boot manager entry.
Examples:
The following command sets two OS entries and the NTLDR based OS loader in
the boot manager display order:
    bcdedit /displayorder {802d5e32-0784-11da-bd33-000476eba25f}
        {cbd971bf-b7b8-4885-951a-fa03044f5d71} {ntldr}
The following command adds the specified OS entry to the end of the boot
manager display order:
    bcdedit /displayorder {802d5e32-0784-11da-bd33-000476eba25f} /addlast
This command sets the one-time boot sequence to be used by the boot
manager.

    <id> [...]      Specifies a list of identifiers that make up the boot
                    sequence. You must specify at least one identifier and must
                    separate identifiers by spaces. For more information about
                    identifiers, run "bcdedit /? ID".
    /addfirst       Adds the specified entry identifier to the top of the boot
                    sequence.  If this switch is specified, only a single
                    identifier may be specified.  If the identifier is already
                    in the list, it is moved to the top of the list.
    /addlast        Adds the specified entry identifier to the end of the boot
                    sequence.  If this switch is specified, only a single
                    identifier may be specified.  If the identifier is already
                    in the list, it is moved to the end of the list.
    /remove         Removes the specified entry identifier from the boot
                    sequence.  If this switch is specified, only a single
                    entry identifier may be specified.  If the identifier is
                    not in the list then the operation has no effect. If
                    the last entry is being removed, then the boot sequence
                    value is deleted from the boot manager entry.
Examples:
The following command sets two OS entries and the NTLDR based OS loader in the
boot manager one-time boot sequence:
    bcdedit /bootsequence {802d5e32-0784-11da-bd33-000476eba25f}
        {cbd971bf-b7b8-4885-951a-fa03044f5d71} {ntldr}
The following command adds the specified OS entry to the end of the boot
manager one-time boot sequence:
    bcdedit /bootsequence {802d5e32-0784-11da-bd33-000476eba25f} /addlast
This command sets or displays the global debugger settings for the system.

                    encrypt the connection.  [0-9] and [a-z] allowed only.
    nodhcp          For network debugging prevents use of DHCP to obtain the
                    target IP address.
    newkey          For network debugging specifies that a new encryption key
                    should be generated for the connection.
    /start <startpolicy>   For all debugger types, this specifies the debugger
                    start policy.  <startpolicy> can be one of the following:
                        ACTIVE
                        AUTOENABLE
                        DISABLE.
                    If not specified, ACTIVE is the default.
    /noumex         If specified, this causes the kernel debugger to ignore any
                    user-mode exceptions.
Examples:
The following command displays the current global debugger settings:
    bcdedit /dbgsettings
The following command sets the global debugger settings to serial debugging
over com1 at 115,200 baud:

The following command sets the global debugger settings to local debugging:
    bcdedit /dbgsettings LOCAL
This command enables or disables the kernel debugger for the specified boot
entry.
bcdedit /debug [<id>] { ON | OFF }
    <id>         Specifies the identifier of the entry to be modified.  Only
                 Windows boot loader entries may be specified.  If not
                 specified, {current} is used. For more information about
                 identifiers, run "bcdedit /? ID".
Examples:
The following command enables kernel debugging for the current Windows
operating system boot entry:
    bcdedit /debug ON
The following command disables kernel debugging for the specified operating
system entry:
    bcdedit /debug {cbd971bf-b7b8-4885-951a-fa03044f5d71} OFF

This command sets the global Emergency Management Services settings for the
system. Emssettings does not enable or disable Emergency Management Services
for any particular boot entry.
bcdedit /emssettings [ BIOS ] | [ EMSPORT:<port> | [EMSBAUDRATE:<baudrate>] ]
    BIOS        Specifies that the system will use BIOS settings for the
                Emergency Management Services configuration. This works only
                on systems that have Emergency Management Services support
                provided by the BIOS.
    <port>      Specifies the serial port to use as the Emergency Management
                Services port. This should not be specified with the BIOS
                option.
    <baudrate>  Specifies the serial baud rate to use for Emergency Management
                Services. This command should not be specified with the BIOS
                option. <baudrate> is optional, and the default is 9,600 baud.
Examples:
The following command sets the Emergency Management Services parameters to use
BIOS settings:
    bcdedit /emssettings BIOS

This command enables or disables Emergency Management Services for the
specified operating system boot entry.
bcdedit /ems [<id>] { ON | OFF }
    <id>    Specifies the identifier of the entry to be modified.  Only
            "Windows boot loader" entries can be specified. If not specified,
            {current} is used. For more information about identifiers, run
            "bcdedit /? ID".
Example:
The following command enables Emergency Management Services for the current
operating system boot entry:
    bcdedit /ems ON
This command enables or disables Emergency Management Services for the
specified entry.
bcdedit /bootems [<id>] { ON | OFF }
    <id>    Specifies the identifier of the entry to be modified. Although this
            command will work for any entry, it is only effective for boot
            applications.
Example:
The following command enables Emergency Management Services for the boot
manager:
    bcdedit /bootems {bootmgr} ON
This command-line option can be used with most Bcdedit commands to specify the
store to be used. If this option is not specified, then the system store is
used.
This option may not be used with the /createstore, /import and /export
commands.
bcdedit /store <filename>
    <filename>  Specifies the file name of the boot configuration data store.
                If the file name contains spaces, it must be enclosed in
                quotation marks ("").
Example:
The following commands list the active entries in the specified data store
file:
    bcdedit /store C:\DATA\BCD /enum ACTIVE
    bcdedit /store "C:\DATA\My BCD" /enum ACTIVE
bcdedit /createstore <filename>
    This command created a new empty boot configuration data store. The
    created store is not a system store.
    <filename>      Specifies the filename of the boot configuration data
                    store.  If the filename contains spaces, it must be
                    enclosed in quotation marks ("").
Example:
The following command creates the specified store file:
    bcdedit /createstore C:\DATA\BCD
bcdedit /import <filename> [/clean]
This command restores the state of the system store using a backup data file
previously generated using the /export command.  Any existing entries in the
system store are deleted before the import takes place.  This command is only
valid for the system store.
    <filename>      The name of the file that is imported into the system store.
                    If the filename contains spaces, it must be enclosed in
                    quotation marks ("").
    /clean          Specifies that all existing firmware boot entries should
                    be deleted (only affects EFI systems).
Example:
The following command imports the specified file into the system store.
    bcdedit /import "C:\Data\BCD Backup" /clean
bcdedit /export <filename>
This command exports the contents of the system store into a file.  This file
can be used later to restore the state of the system store.  This command is
only valid for the system store.
<filename>          The filename to be used as the destination for the export.
                    If the filename contains spaces, it must be enclosed in
                    quotation marks ("").
Example:
The following command exports the system store to the specified file:
    bcdedit /export "C:\Data\BCD Backup"
Usually, any well-known entry identifiers are replaced by their friendly
shorthand form.  Specifying /v as a command-line switch prevents this
replacement and displays all identifiers in full. Running "bcdedit /v" by
itself is equivalent to running "bcdedit /enum ACTIVE /v".
bcdedit /v
Example:
The following command lists the active entries in the system store with all
entry identifiers displayed in full.
    bcdedit /enum ACTIVE /v
bcdedit /toolsdisplayorder <id> [...] [ /addfirst | /addlast | /remove ]
This command will set the display order to be used by the boot manager when
displaying the tools menu.
    <id> [...]      Specifies a list of identifiers that make up the tools
                    display order.  At least one identifier must be specified
                    and they must be separated by spaces.  For more information
                    about identifiers, run "bcdedit /? ID".
    /addfirst       Adds the specified entry identifier to the top of
                    the tools display order.  If this switch is specified, only
                    a single entry identifier may be specified.  If the
                    specified identifier is already in the list, it is
                    moved to the top of the list.
    /addlast        Adds the specified entry identifier to the end of
                    the tools display order.  If this switch is specified, only
                    a single entry identifier may be specified.  If the
                    specified identifier is already in the list, it is
                    moved to the end of the list.
    /remove         Removes the specified entry identifier from the
                    tools display order.  If this switch is specified, only a
                    single entry identifier may be specified.  If the
                    identifier is not in the list, then the operation will have
                    no effect.  If the last entry is being removed, then the
                    tools display order value is deleted from the boot manager
                    entry.
Examples:
The following command sets two tools entries and the memory diagnostic in the
boot manager's tools display order:
    bcdedit /toolsdisplayorder {802d5e32-0784-11da-bd33-000476eba25f}
        {cbd971bf-b7b8-4885-951a-fa03044f5d71} {memdiag}
The following command adds the specified tool entry to the end of the boot
manager's tools display order:
    bcdedit /toolsdisplayorder {802d5e32-0784-11da-bd33-000476eba25f} /addlast
bcdedit /sysstore <devicename>
This command sets the system store device.  This command is only valid for EFI
systems in cases where the system store device is ambiguous.  This setting does
not persist across reboots.
<devicename>        The name of a system partition to set as the the system
                    store device.  The device must be a system partition.
Example:
The following command sets the system store device as specified:
    bcdedit /sysstore C:
IDENTIFIERS
Many of the Bcdedit commands require identifiers. An identifier
uniquely identifies entries contained in the store. An identifier takes the
form of a globally unique identifier, or GUID. A GUID has the following format,
where each "x" represents a hexadecimal digit.
    {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}
For example:
    {d2b69192-8f14-11da-a31f-ea816ab185e9}
The position of the dashes (-) and the braces at the beginning and end of the
GUID are required.
Several entries can be identified by well-known identifiers. If an entry has a
well-known identifier, BCDedit displays it in output unless the /v command-line
switch is used. For more information, run "bcdedit /? /v".
The well-known identifiers are as follows:
    {bootmgr}               Specifies the Windows boot manager entry.
    {fwbootmgr}             Specifies the firmware boot manager entry,
                            specifically on systems that implement the
                            Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) specification.

<datatype> uniquely identifies both the data format and meaning of the value.
Data types are identified using either a name or a custom type. The names are
listed below, along  with their data formats (in parentheses) and a short
description of the custom type. If a format is not specified, then the
description lists the literal values that you can use for that type. For
information about data formats, run "bcdedit /? formats".
The following types are valid for any entry. For information about types that
are specific to a particular entry, such as boot manager entries or the Windows

BOOT SECTOR
Boot Sector type applies to entries that contain bootsector in the form of a
file. Currently there are no additional options for this type.
CUSTOM TYPES
A custom type identifies the data format and meaning of a value that is not
represented by a friendly type name built in to BCDedit. Custom types are
typically used to extend the functionality of BCD.
A custom type has the following format:
     custom:0xXXXXXXXX   The literal string "custom:" followed by an 8-digit
     hexadecimal number that encodes the format and meaning of the type.
A custom type appears in the same parameter position as a friendly type name in
a /set or /deletevalue command. For example:
     bcdedit /set {<id>} custom:0xXXXXXXXX <value>
For information about custom types that can be used with this version of
BCDedit, search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for these keywords: BCD, BCDedit,
custom types
NTLDR based OS LOADER
Currently there are no additional options for this type.
