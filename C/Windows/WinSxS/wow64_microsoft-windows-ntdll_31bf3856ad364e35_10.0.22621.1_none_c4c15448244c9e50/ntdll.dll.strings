 *** Resource timeout (%p) in %ws:%s
The resource is owned exclusively by thread %p
The resource is owned shared by %d threads
The resource is unowned.  This usually implies a slow-moving machine due to memory pressure
 *** Critical Section Timeout (%p) in %ws:%s
The critical section is owned by thread %p.
Go determine why that thread has not released the critical section.
The critical section is unowned.  This usually implies a slow-moving machine due to memory pressure
 *** Inpage error in %ws:%s
The instruction at %p referenced memory at %p.
This failed because of error %Ix.
This means the machine is out of memory.  Use !vm to see where all the memory is being used.
This means the data could not be read, typically because of a bad block on the disk.  Check your hardware.
This means that the I/O device reported an I/O error.  Check your hardware.
 *** An Access Violation occurred in %ws:%s
write to
read from
The instruction at %p tried to %s 
an invalid address, %p
a NULL pointer
 *** A stack buffer overrun occurred in %ws:%s
This is usually the result of a memory copy to a local buffer or structure where the size is not properly calculated/checked.
If this bug ends up in the shipping product, it could be a severe security hole.
The stack trace should show the guilty function (the function directly above __report_gsfailure).
 *** Unhandled exception 0x%08lx, hit in %ws:%s
 *** enter .exr %p for the exception record

STATUS_USER_APC
The requested action was completed by an earlier operation.
STATUS_KERNEL_APC
STATUS_ALERTED
STATUS_TIMEOUT
The operation that was requested is pending completion.
A reparse should be performed by the Object Manager since the name of the file resulted in a symbolic link.
Returned by enumeration APIs to indicate more information is available to successive calls.
Indicates not all privileges or groups referenced are assigned to the caller.
This allows, for example, all privileges to be disabled without having to know exactly which privileges are assigned.
Some of the information to be translated has not been translated.
An open/create operation completed while an oplock break is underway.
A new volume has been mounted by a file system.
This success level status indicates that the transaction state already exists for the registry sub-tree, but that a transaction commit was previously aborted. The commit has now been completed.
This indicates that a notify change request has been completed due to closing the handle which made the notify change request.
This indicates that a notify change request is being completed and that the information is not being returned in the caller's buffer.
The caller now needs to enumerate the files to find the changes.
{No Quotas}

The specified process is not part of a job.
The specified process is part of a job.
{Volume Shadow Copy Service}

The specified ring buffer was empty before the packet was successfully inserted.
The specified ring buffer was full before the packet was successfully removed.
The specified ring buffer has dropped below its quota of outstanding transactions.
The specified ring buffer has, with the removal of the current packet, now become empty.
The specified ring buffer was either previously empty or previously full which implies that the caller should signal the opposite endpoint.
The oplock that was associated with this handle is now associated with a different handle.
The handle with which this oplock was associated has been closed.  The oplock is now broken.
An operation is blocked waiting for an oplock.
A reparse should be performed by the Object Manager from the global root to escape the container name space.

The specified Transaction was unable to be opened, because it was not found.
The specified ResourceManager was unable to be opened, because it was not found.
The specified Enlistment was unable to be opened, because it was not found.
The specified TransactionManager was unable to be opened, because it was not found.
The object specified could not be created or opened, because its associated TransactionManager is not online.  The TransactionManager must be brought fully Online by calling RecoverTransactionManager to recover to the end of its LogFile before objects in its Transaction or ResourceManager namespaces can be opened.  In addition, errors in writing records to its LogFile can cause a TransactionManager to go offline.
The specified TransactionManager was unable to create the objects contained in its logfile in the Ob namespace. Therefore, the TransactionManager was unable to recover.
The call to create a superior Enlistment on this Transaction object could not be completed, because the Transaction object specified for the enlistment is a subordinate branch of the Transaction. Only the root of the Transaction can be enlisted on as a superior.
Because the associated transaction manager or resource manager has been closed, the handle is no longer valid.
The compression operation could not be completed because a transaction is active on the file.
The specified operation could not be performed on this Superior enlistment, because the enlistment was not created with the corresponding completion response in the NotificationMask.
The specified operation could not be performed, because the record that would be logged was too long. This can occur because of two conditions:  either there are too many Enlistments on this Transaction, or the combined RecoveryInformation being logged on behalf of those Enlistments is too long.
The link tracking operation could not be completed because a transaction is active.
This operation cannot be performed in a transaction.
The kernel transaction manager had to abort or forget the transaction because it blocked forward progress.
The TransactionManager identity that was supplied did not match the one recorded in the TransactionManager's log file.
This snapshot operation cannot continue because a transactional resource manager cannot be frozen in its current state.  Please try again.
The transaction cannot be enlisted on with the specified EnlistmentMask, because the transaction has already completed the PrePrepare phase.  In order to ensure correctness, the ResourceManager must switch to a write-through mode and cease caching data within this transaction.  Enlisting for only subsequent transaction phases may still succeed.
The transaction does not have a superior enlistment.
The handle is no longer properly associated with its transaction.  It may have been opened in a transactional resource manager that was subsequently forced to restart.  Please close the handle and open a new one.
The specified operation could not be performed because the resource manager is not enlisted in the transaction.
