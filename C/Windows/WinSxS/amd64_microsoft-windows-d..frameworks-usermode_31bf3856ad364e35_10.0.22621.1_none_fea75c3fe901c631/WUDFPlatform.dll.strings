A driver package which uses user-mode driver framework version %2 is being installed on device %1.
The UMDF service %1 (CLSID %2) was installed.  It requires framework version %3 or higher.
The UMDF service %1 (CLSID %2) was upgraded.  It requires framework version %3 or higher.
The driver package installation has succeeded.
The driver package installation has failed.  The final status was %1.
A problem has occurred with one or more user-mode drivers and the hosting process has been terminated.  This may temporarily interrupt your ability to access the devices.
The device %2 (location %3) is offline due to a user-mode driver crash.  Windows will attempt to restart the device %5 more times.  Please contact the device manufacturer for more information about this problem.
The device %2 (location %3) is offline due to a user-mode device crash.  Windows will no longer attempt to restart this device because the maximum restart limit has been reached.  Disconnecting the device and reconnecting it, or disabling it and re-enabling it from the device manager, will reset this limit and allow the device to be accessed again.  Please contact the device manufacturer for more information about this problem.
The device %2 was unable to start due to conflict between the settings for driver %5 (%3 - %4) and the other drivers.  Windows will not be able to start this device.  Please contact the device manufacturer for assistance.
The device %2 (location %3) is offline due to a user-mode driver crash.  Windows will attempt to restart the device %5 more times in its own process.  Please contact the device manufacturer for more information about this problem.
The device %2 (location %3) is offline due to a user-mode driver crash.  Windows will attempt to restart the device in the shared process %5 more times before moving the device in its own process.  Please contact the device manufacturer for more information about this problem.
UMDF driver service %1 failed to load because it was compiled using a pre-release version of the Windows Driver Kit(WDK). The driver should be recompiled using a release version of the WDK. Driver's function table count is %2 and the expected count is %3.
UMDF reflector is unable to connect to service control manager (SCM). This is expected during boot, when SCM has not started yet. Will retry when it starts.
