This is an optional command that may not be supported by the computer manufacturer.
TPM_CreateRevocableEK
Endorsement Key Handling
This command clears a revocable TPM endorsement key (generated by TPM_CreateRevocableEK) and resets the TPM, if it finds the correct authorization value for this reset. This command requires physical presence at the platform and cannot be run by the operating system.
TPM_RevokeTrust
Endorsement Key Handling
yThis command allows the TPM owner to return the public portion of the TPM endorsement key (EK) or storage root key (SRK).
TPM_OwnerReadInternalPub

TPM_GetAuditDigest
Auditing
VThis command returns a signed TPM audit digest and list of currently audited commands.
TPM_GetAuditDigestSigned
Admin Ownership
This command takes ownership of the TPM with a new owner authorization value, derived from the owner password. Among other conditions that must be met before this command can run, the TPM must be enabled and activated.
TPM_TakeOwnership
Deleted Commands
;This command has been removed because of security concerns.
TPM_GetOrdinalAuditStatus
Auditing
This command allows the TPM owner to set the audit flag for a given command number. When this flag is turned on, the command returns an audit to the audit digest and the command is added to the list of currently audited commands.
TPM_SetOrdinalAuditStatus
Deprecated Commands
sThis command is superseded by establishing a transport session with the TPM and running the TPM_ChangeAuth command.
TPM_ChangeAuthAsymStart
Deprecated Commands
<This command is superseded by the TPM_FlushSpecific command.
TPM_Terminate_Handle
Admin Startup and State
This is the first command sent by the computer. During the boot process, this command is sent to the TPM. This command cannot be run by software.
TPM_Init
Admin Startup and State
IThis command warns the TPM to save state before entering the sleep state.
TPM_SaveState
Admin Startup and State
This command must follow the TPM_Init command. It transmits additional computer information to the TPM about the type of reset that is occurring at the time of the call.
TPM_Startup
%Administrative Functions - Management
nThis command allows the TPM to directly communicate with a connected security processor by redirecting output.
TPM_SetRedirection
Deprecated Commands
sThis command is superseded by establishing a transport session with the TPM and running the TPM_ChangeAuth command.
TPM_ChangeAuthAsymFinish
Cryptographic Functions
This command starts the process of calculating a SHA-1 digest. This command must be followed by execution of TPM_SHA1Update or the SHA-1 process is invalidated.
TPM_SHA1Start
Cryptographic Functions
cThis command inputs complete blocks of data into a pending SHA-1 digest (started by TPM_SHA1Start).
TPM_SHA1Update
Cryptographic Functions
bThis command completes a pending SHA-1 digest process and returns the resulting SHA-1 hash output.
TPM_SHA1Complete

TPM_SHA1CompleteExtend
Changing AuthData
This command allows the TPM owner to change the TPM owner authorization value or the storage root key (SRK) authorization value.
TPM_ChangeAuthOwner
%Administrative Functions - Management
rThis command allows a manufacturer upgrade of TPM functionality. This command is specific to the TPM manufacturer.
TPM_FieldUpgrade
Authorization Sessions
This command generates an authorization session handle for the Delegate-Specific Authorization Protocol (DSAP) used to securely pass delegated authorization data to the TPM and the information the TPM needs to track this authorization session handle.
TPM_DSAP
Deprecated Commands
