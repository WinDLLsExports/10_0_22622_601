-Cannot add a duplicate collector to a target.
.Cannot add a duplicate diagnostic to a target.
/Cannot add a duplicate synthesizer to a target.
?A circular dependency was detected while executing diagnostics.
The collector did not pass verification despite reporting success.  This can indicate a version mismatch between the trace file and the diagnostic module.
RDiagnostic is marked with a role-dependency that is not required by the parent set
;Diagnostics may only depend on collectors and synthesizers.
=Diagnostic set was called without the required roles present.
WThis diagnostic has been superseded by a more powerful diagnostic and has been skipped.
,{0} could not be parsed into a known status.
DSynthesizer dependencies should be declared as generic dependencies.
}Synthesizer is marked as a dependency of a diagnostic that does not require the necessary roles for running this synthesizer.
2Synthesizers may not depend on other synthesizers.
+Synthesizers may only depend on collectors.
4Failed to initialize the collection directory "{0}".
3Could not locate the collection directory at "{0}".
The trace results format {0} is unsupported.  The diagnostic engine can only read trace results using format 1.0.0.0.  Recollect the traces using a supported version of the diagnostic engine and try again.
