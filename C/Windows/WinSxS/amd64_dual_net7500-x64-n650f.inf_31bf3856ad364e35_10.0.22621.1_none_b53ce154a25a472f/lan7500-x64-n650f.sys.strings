Translation
The Lan7500 driver completed it's initialization successfully, (%1): %2 : %3.
The request to reset the device was dismissed since the driver detected the device had been surprise removed.
The Node Address specified through the device's Advanced Properties is invalid (it is either multicast, broadcast or does NOT have the locally administered bit set) and will be disregarded.
Custom Media Type was selected, but the Advertised Capabilities were not present or invalid. Advertised Capabilities were overiden for all modes advertised.
Custom Media Type was selected and the Advertised Capabilities specify full duplex support but there is a mismatch in advertised flow control and explicit flow control settings. Advertised capabilities were overiden to advertise pause generation as per explicit Flow Control settings.
Automatic Media Type selection with speeds higher than 10 Mbps was selected, but the device is connected to a full speed (12 Mbps max) USB port which cannot handle such data bandwidth. 
Therefore advertised modes were restricted to 10Mbps modes. If advertising higher speeds is really required change the port your device is connected to a high speed capable USB port.
Wake up options are enabled in the drivers advanced properties but the device hardware does not support wake up as per it's USB Configuration descriptor.
Wake up options are enabled in the drivers advanced properties but the device hardware does not support wake up since it disables all power management with it's 'PowerManagement' registry key.
Proprietary MediaType registry specified value (%1) was overwritten with (%2) to match Standard *SpeedDuplex registry setting.
Proprietary FlowControl registry specified value (%1) was overwritten with (%2) to match Standard *FlowControl registry setting.
An event the driver was waiting for unexpectedly timed-out.
A condition the driver was waiting for unexpectedly timed-out.
The driver attempted to reset the device and during this procedure a USB port reset was attempted 3 times but this failed. 
Please try reinstalling the driver. If the problem persists it could be indicative of a device malfunction.
The driver attempted to reset the device and failed. This could be a symptom of a faulty adapter. 
Please try reinstalling the driver. If the problem persists it could be indicative of a device malfunction.
This driver waited several seconds for a resource to be freed by the Windows Operating System when Windows should have done so, but this did not occur. In order to continue operation it disregarded this error, therefore potentially "leaking" this resource. 
Operation may continue normally but if this error continues to happen it could eventually lead to driver malfunction or operating system instability. The system should be reboot when possible to prevent the latter.
This driver received an unexpected interrupt status code via its interrupt pipe. Please report this error to the manufacturer. 
This driver encountered an error when attempting to change the device power state. 
The Node Address specified through the device's Advanced Properties is not localy administered address.
This driver encountered an error when receiving (single packet). 
This driver encountered an error when receiving (multi packet). 
This driver encountered an error while reading a register. 
This driver encountered an error while writing a register. 
Unexpected reset after sleep. 
Timeout in USBAbortPipe. 
Timeout in USBGetPortStatus.
This device requires support for the Ethernet_802.3 Medium. 
This could be a symptom of a faulty driver installation, please reinstall.
This driver was unable to allocate sufficient memory for this device to operate.
This driver was unable to initialize or de-initialize the USB section of the device.
This could be a symptom of a faulty device.
This driver was unable to perform initialization on the device.
This could be a symptom of a faulty driver installation, please reinstall.
This driver was unable to allocate an I/O workitem.
Error trying to open the Registry instance for this device in order to read from it.
During hardware self-test, this driver timed out while waiting for the device to complete its reset operation. 
This could be a symptom of a faulty adapter.
During hardware self-test, the driver could not verify the accessibility of MAC registers using the device's USB Control endpoint. 
Try reinstalling the driver to fix this problem. If the issue persists this could be indicative of a hardware malfunction. 
During hardware configuration, the driver could not communicate with the physical layer device (PHY) attached to the MAC.
This could be a symptom of a faulty adapter.
