CopyState describes the state of the association with respect to replication activity. Values are: 
2 - 'Initialized': The link to enable replication is established and source/replica elements are associated, but the copy operation has not started. 
3 - 'Unsynchronized': Not all the source element data has been copied to the target element. 
4 - 'Synchronized': For the Mirror, Snapshot, or Clone replication, the target represents a copy of the source. 
5 - 'Broken': The relationship is non-functional due to errors in the source, the target, the path between the two or space constraints. 
6 - 'Fractured': Target is split from the source. 
7 - 'Split': The target element was gracefully (or systematically) split from its source element -- consistency is guaranteed. 
8 - 'Inactive': Copy operation has stopped, writes to source element will not be sent to target element. 
9 - 'Suspended': Data flow between the source and target elements has stopped. Writes to source element are held until the association is resumed. 
10 - 'Failedover': Reads and writes to/from the target element. Source element is not reachable. 
11 - 'Prepared': Initialization completed and the copy operation started; however, the data flow has not started. 
12 - 'Aborted': The copy operation is aborted with the Abort operation. Use the Resync Replica operation to restart the copy operation. 
13 - 'Skewed': The target has been modified and is no longer synchronized with the source element or the point-in-time view. 
14 - 'Mixed': Applies to the CopyState of GroupSynchronized. It indicates the StorageSynchronized associations of the elements in the groups have different CopyState values.

ReplicaType provides information on how the Replica is being maintained. Values are: 
2 - 'Full Copy': This indicates that a full copy of the source object is (or will be) generated . 
3 - 'Before Delta': This indicates that the source object will be maintained as a delta data from the replica. 
4 - 'After Delta': This indicates that the replica will be maintained as delta data from the source object. 
5 - 'Log': This indicates that the replica object is being maintained as a log of changes to the source. 
0 - 'Not Specified': The method of maintaining the copy is not specified.

ReplicaType
SyncState describes the state of the association with respect to Replication activity. Values are: 
2 - 'Initialized': The link to enable replication is established and source/replica elements are associated, but the Copy engine has not started. 
3 - 'PrepareInProgress': Preparation for Replication is in progress and the Copy engine has started. 
4 - 'Prepared': All necessary preparation has completed. 
5 - 'ResyncInProgress': Synchronization or Resynchronization is in progress. This may be the initial 'copy' or subsequent changes being copied. 
6 - 'Synchronized': An Async or Sync replication is currently synchronized. When this value is set, SyncMaintained will be true.

Synchronized status of a storage object and its Snapshots / Clones / Mirrors.
ObjectId is a mandatory property that is used to opaquely and uniquely identify an instance of a class. ObjectIds must be unique within the scope of the management server (which is hosting the provider). The ObjectId is created and maintained for use of the Storage Management Providers and their clients to track instances of objects. If an object is visible through two different paths (for example: there are two separate Storage Management Providers that point to the same storage subsystem) then the same object may appear with two different ObjectIds. For determining if two object instances are the same object, refer to the UniqueId property.
ObjectId
MSFT_StorageObject
UniqueId is a mandatory property that is used to uniquely identify a logical instance of a storage subsystem's object. This value must be the same for an object viewed by two or more provider instances (even if they are running on seperate management servers). UniqueId can be any globally unique, opaque value unless otherwise specified by a derived class.
UniqueId
PassThroughIds is a comma-separated list of all implementation specific keys. It is used by storage management applications to access the vendor proprietary object model. This field should be in the form: key1='value1',key2='value2'.
PassThroughIds
PassThroughServer is the name or address of the computer system hosting the proprietary storage provider classes.
PassThroughServer
PassThroughNamespace is the WBEM namespace that contains the proprietary storage provider classes.
PassThroughNamespace
PassThroughClass is the WBEM class name of the proprietary storage provider object.

Message
An array containing the dynamic content of the message.
MessageArguments
An enumerated value that describes the severity of the Indication from the notifier's point of view: 
0 - the Perceived Severity of the indication is unknown or indeterminate. 
1 - Other, by CIM convention, is used to indicate that the Severity's value can be found in the OtherSeverity property. 
2 - Information should be used when providing an informative response. 
3 - Degraded/Warning should be used when its appropriate to let the user decide if action is needed. 
4 - Minor should be used to indicate action is needed, but the situation is not serious at this time. 
5 - Major should be used to indicate action is needed NOW. 
6 - Critical should be used to indicate action is needed NOW and the scope is broad (perhaps an imminent outage to a critical resource will result). 
7 - Fatal/NonRecoverable should be used to indicate an error occurred, but it's too late to take remedial action. 
2 and 0 - Information and Unknown (respectively) follow common usage. Literally, the Error is purely informational or its severity is simply unknown.

MSFT_Disk.ObjectId
DiskId
MSFT_Partition
The operating system's number for the disk that contains this partition. Disk numbers may not necessarily remain the same across reboots.
MSFT_Disk.Number
DiskNumber
The operating system's number for the partition. Ordering is based on the partition's offset, relative to other partitions. This means that the value for this property may change based off of the partition configuration in the offset range preceding this partition.
PartitionNumber
The currently assigned drive letter to the partition. This property is NULL if no drive letter has been assigned.
DriveLetter
This property is an array of all the various mount points for the partition. This list includes drive letters, as well as mounted folders.

GptType
This property is a string representation of the partition's GPT GUID. This property is only valid if the disk's PartitionStyle property is set to 2 - 'GPT' and will be NULL for all other partition stlyes.
IsReadOnly
IsOffline
IsSystem
IsBoot
Signifies whether or not the partition is active and can be booted. This property is only relevant for MBR disks.
IsActive
If this property is set to TRUE, the partition is not detected by the mount manager. As a result, the partition does not receive a drive letter, does not receive a volume GUID path, does not host volume mount points, and is not enumerated by calls to FindFirstVolume and FindNextVolume. This ensures that applications such as disk defragmenter do not access the partition. The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) uses this attribute on its shadow copies.
IsHidden
If this property is set to TRUE, the partition is a shadow copy of another partition. This attribute is used by the Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS). This attribute is an indication for file system filter driver-based software (such as antivirus programs) to avoid attaching to the volume. An application can use this attribute to differentiate a shadow copy partition from a production partition. For example, an application that performs a fast recovery will break a shadow copy virtual disk by clearing the read-only and hidden attributes and this attribute. This attribute is set when the shadow copy is created and cleared when the shadow copy is broken.
IsShadowCopy
IsDAX
If this property is set to TRUE, the operating system does not assign a drive letter automatically when the partition is discovered. This is only honored for GPT disks and is assumed to be FALSE for MBR disks. This attribute is useful in storage area network (SAN) environments.

RequestStateChange changes the state of a job. The possible values are as follows: 
2 - 'Start' changes the state to 'Running'. 
3 - 'Suspend' stops the job temporarily. The intention is to subsequently restart the job with a second call to RequestStateChange requesting 1 - 'Start'. It might be possible to enter the 'Service' state while suspended. (This is job-specific.) 
4 - 'Terminate' stops the job cleanly, saving data, preserving the state, and shutting down all underlying processes in an orderly manner. 
5 - 'Kill' terminates the job immediately with no requirement to save data or preserve the state. 
6 - 'Service' puts the job into a vendor-specific service state. It might be possible to restart the job.

Maintenance2
This method resets the health and operational status of the physical disk. Exact behavior of this method is dependent on whether this physical disk belongs to a concrete pool. 
If it is a member of a concrete pool, the health and operational statuses should be reset to 1 - 'Healthy', and 1 - 'OK', respectively. If any additional errors are detected after Reset, the health and operational statuses should reflect these new errors. 
If the physical disk is not a member of a concrete pool, then this method should not only reset the health and operational statuses, but it should return the disk into a state where it is usable as storage for a concrete pool. For example: If a physical disk had become missing and then has reappeared (after it has been replaced) this physical disk is expected to be in the primordial pool only with an operational status indicating its data is either split or unrecognized. Calling Reset should clear the physical disk of any data, remove any remaining ties to its former concrete pool, and return the disk to a healthy, usable state.

If Usage is set to 1 - 'Other', this field contains the string representation of the vendor defined usage for the storage pool. This property must be NULL if Usage is not set to 1 - 'Other'.
If this field is set to TRUE, the storage pool is primordial. A primordial pool, also known as the 'available storage' pool is where storage capacity is drawn and returned in the creation and deletion of concrete storage pools. Primordial pools cannot be created or deleted. 
If this field is set to FALSE, the storage pool is a concrete pool. These pools are subject to all of the management operations defined on the storage pool class. This includes creation, deletion, creation of virtual disks, etc.
IsPrimordial
Denotes the current health status of the storage pool. Health of a storage pool is derived from the health of the backing physical disks, and whether or not the storage pool can maintain the required levels of resiliency.
 0 - 'Healthy': All physical disks are present and in a healthy state. 
1 - 'Warning': The majority of physical disks are healthy, but one or more may be failing I/O requests. 
2 - 'Unhealthy': The majority of physical disks are unhealthy or in a failed state, and the pool no longer has data integrity.
Indicates the current operating conditions of the storage pool. Unlike HealthStatus, this field indicates the status of hardware, software, and infrastructure issues related to this storage pool, and can contain multiple values. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail. 
4 - 'Stressed': indicates that the storage pool is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of 'Stressed' states are overload, overheated, and so on. 
5 - 'Predictive Failure': indicates that the storage pool is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future. 
11 - 'In Service': describes a storage pool being configured, maintained, or otherwise administered. 
12 - 'No Contact': indicates that the storage provider has knowledge of this storage pool, but has never been able to establish communications with it. 
13 - 'Lost Communication': indicates that the storage pool is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable. 
10 - 'Stopped' and 14 - 'Aborted' are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the storage pool might need to be updated. 
15 - 'Dormant': indicates that the storage pool is inactive. 
16 - 'Supporting Entity in Error': indicates that this storage pool might be OK, but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. 
Indicates the capacity of the storage pool. If the pool is primordial, this is the sum of all the healthy physical disk sizes. If the pool is concrete, this is the sum of all associated physical disks (except hot-spares, and including failed drives).
Indicates the total sum of all the capacity used by this storage pool. If the pool is primordial, this will be the sum of all capacity currently allocated to concrete storage pools. If the pool is concrete, this value should be the sum of all capacity currently allocated to virtual disks and other pool metadata.
This field indicates the logical sector size of the storage pool, in bytes. This value is derived from the backing physical disks, as well as the preference specified at the time this storage pool was created.
This field indicates the physical sector size of the storage pool, in bytes. This value is derived from the backing physical disks for this storage pool.

Denotes the reason why the storage pool is read-only. 
1 - 'None': The pool is not read-only. 
2 - 'By Policy': The administrator has either requested the pool to be read-only or has enacted a policy on the system that requires the pool to be read-only. 
3 - 'Majority Disks Unhealthy': The majority of the supporting physical disks are in an unhealthy state that has forced the storage pool into a read-only state.
ReadOnlyReason
Indicates whether or not the storage pool is used in a clustered environment.
IsClustered
If TRUE, this storage pool supports data deduplication.
SupportsDeduplication

ClearOnDeallocate
This property indicates whether the disks comprising this pool are able to tolerate power loss without data loss, e.g. automatically flush volatile buffers to non-volatile media after external power is disconnected.
This property indicates how the operating system will proceed with repairing of virtual disks for this storage pool.
2 - 'Sequential': repair will process one allocation slab at a time. This will result in longer repair times, but small impact on the I/O load.
3 - 'Parallel': repair will process as many allocation slabs as it can in parallel. This will result in the shortest repair time, but will have significant impact on I/O load.
Sequential
Parallel
RepairPolicy

This method creates a virtual disk using the resources of the storage pool. This method is available only when the SupportsVirtualDiskCreation property on the storage subsystem is set to TRUE. If it is set to FALSE, this method will fail with MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED. This method is also not supported for primordial pools. 
Creating tiered virtual disks is available only when the SupportsStorageTieredVirtualDiskCreation property on the storage subsystem is set to TRUE. If it is set to FALSE, this method will fail with MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED. 
CreateVirtualDisk requires only FriendlyName and Size to be specified. Sizes can be specified explicitly through the Size parameter, or you can use the maximum available space from the storage pool by specifying the UseMaximumSize parameter. Both FriendlyName and Size are treated as goals rather than hard requirements. For example, not all SMI-S based arrays support custom friendly names; however, the virtual disk creation will still succeed. If the size specified is not achieved, the actual size used for the virtual disk will be returned in the out parameter structure. 
The usage of this virtual disk can be set using the Usage and OtherUsageDescription parameters. If a value for OtherUsageDescription is given, Usage must be set to 1 - 'Other', otherwise an error will be returned. 
By default, the resiliency setting applied to this virtual disk will be whatever is specified in the storage pool's ResiliencySettingNameDefault property. This can be overridden using the ResiliencySettingName parameter. Note that the name given here must correspond to a resiliency setting associated with this storage pool. Any other value will result in an error. 
Individual settings of the resiliency setting can be overridden using the NumberOfDataCopies, PhysicalDiskRedundancy, NumberOfColumns, and Interleave parameters. If these parameters are not used, the defaults from the resiliency setting will be used. These overrides will not persist back to the particular resiliency setting instance; however some storage providers may choose to create a new resiliency setting instance to capture this new configuration. If any of the goals specified in the override parameters are out of range, or are not supported by the storage pool, an error will be returned. 
The provisioning policy for the virtual disk is determined in a similar way to the resiliency setting. If no preference is specified in the ProvisioningType parameter, the policy is determined by the storage pool's ProvisioningTypeDefault property. If the ProvisioningType parameter is specified, the default is ignored and the value specified will be used instead. 
Allocation can be further controlled by the PhysicalDisksToUse parameter. There may be certain scenarios where a storage administrator wants to manually choose which physical disks should back the virtual disk. When this parameter is specified, data for the virtual disk will only be stored on the physical disks in this array and not on any others.

This parameter allows the user to specify the FriendlyName at the time of the virtual disk creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not required to be unique. Note that some storage subsystems do not allow setting a friendly name during virtual disk creation. If a subsystem doesn't support this, virtual disk creation should still succeed, however the disk may have a different name assigned to it.
Indicates the size for the virtual disk. Note that some storage subsystems will round the size up or down to a multiple of its allocation unit size. This parameter cannot be used if UseMaximumSize is set to TRUE.

Specifies the number of underlying physical disks across which data should be striped. If specified, this value will override the NumberOfColumnsDefault value that would have been inherited from the resiliency setting specified by ResiliencySettingName.
If TRUE, this field instructs the storage provider (or subsystem) to automatically pick what it determines to be the best number of columns for the virtual disk. If this field is TRUE, then the NumberOfColumns parameter must be NULL.
AutoNumberOfColumns
Specifies the number of bytes that should be used for a strip in the common striping-based resiliency settings. The strip is defined as the size of the portion of a stripe that lies on one physical disk. Thus Interleave * NumberOfColumns will yield the size of one stripe of user data. If this parameter is specified, this value will override the InterleaveDefault which would have been inherited from the resiliency setting specified by ResiliencySettingName.
Determines the allocation behavior for this virtual disk. Enclosure aware virtual disks will intelligently pick the physical disks to use for their redundancy. If TRUE, the virtual disk will attempt to use physical disks from different enclosures to balance the fault tolerance between two (or more) physical enclosures.

Denotes the object types supported for Deduplication in this subsystem.
StoragePool
SupportedDeduplicationObjectTypes
Denotes the file system types supported for Deduplication in this subsystem.
SupportedDeduplicationFileSystemTypes
This method creates a storage pool from available physical disks contained within a common primordial pool. A physical disk is available for storage pool creation if its CanPool property is set to TRUE. Storage pool creation is only available when the SupportsStoragePoolCreation field of the storage subsystem is TRUE.
51005
Object Not Found
One or more physical disks are not connected to the nodes on which the pool is being created.
This parameter allows the user to specify the FriendlyName at the time of the storage pool creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not required to be unique. Note that some storage subsystems do not allow setting a friendly name during pool creation. If a subsystem doesn't support this, storage pool creation should still succeed, however the pool may have a different name assigned to it.
Allows a user to set a custom usage type for the new storage pool object. This parameter can only be specified if the Usage parameter is set to 1 - 'Other'. 
This parameter is used to specify an array of physical disk objects that will be used as the backing data storage for the created storage pool. The physical disks must come from a primordial pool on the subsystem on which you are creating this pool. Only the disks from a single primordial pool may be used.
This parameter indicates the resiliency setting to be used by default when creating a new virtual disk on this storage pool. If the subsystem's SupportsMultipleResiliencySettingsPerStoragePool property is set to FALSE, this parameter also acts as a hint to the Storage Management Provider on which resiliency setting should be inherited by this storage pool. If no value is given, it is up to the Storage Management Provider to pick the most appropriate resiliency setting.
This parameter indicates the provisioning type to be used by default when creating a new virtual disk on this storage pool. If no default is specified, the default is inherited from the primordial pool.
This parameter indicates the default logical sector size for the storage pool. This is useful when a storage pool may contain a mix of 512 emulated and either 4K native or 512 native physical disks.
LogicalSectorSizeDefault
Indicates if provider should pick up the auto write cache size or not
CreatedStoragePool
CreateStoragePool
CreateStoragePool2
This method allows for the creation of virtual disks on a storage subsystem. This method is typically used when either a) the subsystem's storage pools do not allow virtual disk creation directly, or b) the subsystem does not support storage pools. Storage Management Providers may also choose to implement this method to 'intelligently' pick a storage pool for the user. If this method is supported, the subsystem's SupportsAutomaticStoragePoolSelection property should be set to TRUE.
47000
No storage pools were found that can support this virtual disk configuration.
This parameter allows the user to specify the desired FriendlyName at the time of the virtual disk creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not required to be unique. Note that some storage subsystems do not allow setting a friendly name during virtual disk creation. If a subsystem doesn't support this, virtual disk creation should still succeed, however the disk may have a different name assigned to it.
Allows a user to set a custom usage type for the new virtual disk object. This parameter can only be specified if the Usage parameter is set to 1 - 'Other'. 
Indicates the desired size for the virtual disk. Note that some storage subsystems will round the size up or down to a multiple of its allocation unit size. If this parameter is specified, UseMaximumSize must be NULL or FALSE.
Create a virtual disk using the largest supported size. This parameter cannot be used with the Size parameter.
Specifies the number of complete data copies to maintain for this virtual disk.
Specifies how many physical disk failures the virtual disk should be able to withstand before data loss occurs.
Specifies the number of underlying physical disks across which data should be striped.
Specifies the number of bytes used to form a strip in common striping-based resiliency settings. The strip is defined as the size of the portion of a stripe that lies on one physical disk. Thus Interleave * NumberOfColumns will yield the total size of one stripe.
This field specifies whether a parity-based resiliency setting is using a rotated or non-rotated parity layout. If the resiliency setting is not parity based, this field must be set to NULL
Denotes the provisioning type of the virtual disk. A value of 1 - 'Thin' means that the storage for the disk is allocated on-demand. A value of 2 - 'Fixed' means that the storage is allocated up front.
Creates logical grouping of virtual disks, target ports, and initiators for the purpose of showing virtual disks to host systems.
This parameter allows the user to specify the desired FriendlyName for the masking set at the time of its creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not requried to be unique.
This parameter specifies the list of virtual disks to show to the initiators in the masking set. The identifier used by this parameter is the virtual disk Name property. This parameter has a 1:1 mapping with the DeviceAccesses parameter (the arrays must be the same length and have the same order).
This parameter specifies the level of access the initiator should have to each virtual disk specified by VirtualDiskNames. This parameter has a 1:1 mapping with the VirtualDiskNames parameter (the arrays must be the same length and have the same order).
Specifies the order in which the virtual disks should be exposed to the initiator. This capability is only available if the storage subsystem's MaskingClientSelectableDeviceNumbers property is set to TRUE. If specified, this parameter must have a 1:1 mapping with the VirtualDiskNames parameter.
This parameter specifies the target ports which should be used when showing the virtual disks to the initiators. The number of target ports that can be specified depends on the subsystem's MaskingPortsPerView property. If MaskingPortsPerView is set to 4 - 'All target ports share the same view', this parameter is essentially ignored as all target ports on the system will be associated with this masking set.
This parameter specifies the initiators for which the virtual disks should be shown. If the subsystem's MaskingOneInitiatorIdPerView property is TRUE, only one initiator can be specified for this masking set. The list of valid initiator address formats can be determined through the subsystem's MaskingValidInitiatorIdTypes property.
InitiatorAddresses
Designates the host operating system or other host environment factors that may influence the behavior the storage subsystem should take when showing a virtual disk to an initiator.
CreatedMaskingSet
CreateMaskingSet
This method allows a user to set the description field of the storage subsystem.

MSFT_StorageEvent
SourceInstance
This field allows the Storage Management Provider (SMP) to provide a brief description explaining the indication.
Denotes the date and time in which the event that triggered this indication occurred.
EventTime
Denotes the perceived severity of the event from the notifier's point of view. 
0 - 'Unknown': The severity is unknown or indeterminate. 
2 - 'Information': The event is for informative purposes. 
3 - 'Degraded/Warning': Action may be required by the user. 
4 - 'Minor': Action is needed, but the situation is not serious at this time. 
5 - 'Major': Immediate action is needed. 
6 - 'Critical': Immediate action is needed and the scope of the issue is broad. 
7 - 'Fatal/NonRecoverable': An error has occurred, but it is too late to take remedial action. 
This field indicates the object that caused the indication.
MSFT_StorageObject.ObjectId
SourceObjectId
This field indicates the class of the object which caused the indication. For example: if the object causing the indication is a storage pool, this field should be set to MSFT_StoragePool (not the vendor derived class).
SourceClassName
SourceNamespace
SourceServer
Base storage event indication
Storage arrival events are used whenever a storage object is added or created.
MSFT_StorageArrivalEvent
WSP_ReplicationGroupStorageArrivalEvent
Storage departure events are used whenever a storage object is removed or deleted.
MSFT_StorageDepartureEvent
WSP_ReplicationGroupStorageDepartureEvent
Storage modification events are used when the underlying state of an object has changed. Not all properties should be tracked (for example AllocatedSize may change so frequently that sending events would be impractical). At a minimum, an event should be sent any time an objects HealthStatus or OperationalStatus properties change.
