----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The user dump currently examined is a minidump. Consequently, only a subset
of sos.dll functionality will be available. If needed, attaching to the live
process or debugging a full dump will allow access to sos.dll's full feature
To create a full user dump use the command: .dump /ma <filename>

SOS: Failed to register callback events
Failed to find runtime DLL (clr.dll), 0x%08x
Extension commands need clr.dll in order to have something to do.
Failed to load data access DLL, 0x%08x
Verify that 1) you have a recent build of the debugger (6.2.14 or newer)
            2) the file mscordacwks.dll that matches your version of clr.dll is 
                in the version directory or on the symbol path
            3) or, if you are debugging a dump file, verify that the file 
                mscordacwks_<arch>_<arch>_<version>.dll is on your symbol path.
            4) you are debugging on supported cross platform architecture as 
                the dump file. For example, an ARM dump file must be debugged
                on an X86 or an ARM machine; an AMD64 dump file must be
                debugged on an AMD64 machine.
You can also run the debugger command .cordll to control the debugger's
load of mscordacwks.dll.  .cordll -ve -u -l will do a verbose reload.
If that succeeds, the SOS command should work on retry.
If you are debugging a minidump, you need to make sure that your executable
path is pointing to clr.dll as well.

The garbage collector data structures are not in a valid state for traversal.
It is either in the "plan phase," where objects are being moved around, or
we are at the initialization or shutdown of the gc heap. Commands related to 
displaying, finding or traversing objects as well as gc heap segments may not 
work properly. !dumpheap and !verifyheap may incorrectly complain of heap 
consistency errors.

Some handles were not found. If the number of not-found handles grows over the
lifetime of your application, you may have a GCHandle leak. This will cause   
the GC Heap to grow larger as objects are being kept alive, referenced only   
by the orphaned handle. If the number doesn't grow over time, note that there 
may be some noise in this output, as an unmanaged application may be storing  
the handle in a non-standard way, perhaps with some bits flipped. The memory  
scan wouldn't be able to find those.                                          
Didn't find %d handles:
All handles found
 even though you aborted.
A leak may still exist because in a general scan of process memory SOS can't  
differentiate between garbage and valid structures, so you may have false     
positives. If you still suspect a leak, use this function over time to        
identify a possible trend.

COMMAND: faq.
>> Where can I get the right version of SOS for my build?
If you are running version 1.1 or 2.0 of the CLR, SOS.DLL is installed in the 
same directory as the main CLR dll (CLR.DLL). Newer versions of the 
Windows Debugger provide a command to make it easy to load the right copy of 
SOS.DLL:
    ".loadby sos clr"
That will load the SOS extension DLL from the same place that CLR.DLL is 
loaded in the process. You shouldn't attempt to use a version of SOS.DLL that 
doesn't match the version of CLR.DLL. You can find the version of 
CLR.DLL by running 
    "lmvm clr"
in the debugger.  Note that if you are running CoreCLR (e.g. Silverlight)
then you should replace "clr" with "coreclr".
If you are using a dump file created on another machine, it is a little bit
more complex. You need to make sure the mscordacwks.dll file that came with
that install is on your symbol path, and you need to load the corresponding
version of sos.dll (typing .load <full path to sos.dll> rather than using the
.loadby shortcut). Within the Microsoft corpnet, we keep tagged versions 
of mscordacwks.dll, with names like mscordacwks_<architecture>_<version>.dll
that the Windows Debugger can load. If you have the correct symbol path to the
binaries for that version of the Runtime, the Windows Debugger will load the
correct mscordacwks.dll file.
>> I have a chicken and egg problem. I want to use SOS commands, but the CLR
   isn't loaded yet. What can I do?
In the debugger at startup you can type:
    "sxe clrn"
Let the program run, and it will stop with the notice
    "CLR notification: module 'mscorlib' loaded"
At this time you can use SOS commands. To turn off spurious notifications,
type:
    "sxd clrn"    
>> I got the following error message. Now what?
0:000> .loadby sos clr
0:000> !DumpStackObjects
Failed to find runtime DLL (clr.dll), 0x80004005
Extension commands need clr.dll in order to have something to do.
0:000>
This means that the CLR is not loaded yet, or has been unloaded. You need to 
wait until your managed program is running in order to use these commands. If 
you have just started the program a good way to do this is to type 
    bp clr!EEStartup "g @$ra"
in the debugger, and let it run. After the function EEStartup is finished, 
there will be a minimal managed environment for executing SOS commands.
>> I have a partial memory minidump, and !DumpObj doesn't work. Why?
In order to run SOS commands, many CLR data structures need to be traversed. 
When creating a minidump without full memory, special functions are called at
dump creation time to bring those structures into the minidump, and allow a 
minimum set of SOS debugging commands to work. At this time, those commands 
that can provide full or partial output are:
CLRStack
Threads
PrintException
EEVersion
For a minidump created with this minimal set of functionality in mind, you
will get an error message when running any other commands. A full memory dump
(obtained with ".dump /ma <filename>" in the Windows Debugger) is often the 
best way to debug a managed program at this level.
>> What other tools can I use to find my bug?
Turn on Managed Debugging Assistants. These enable additional runtime diagnostics, 
particularly in the area of PInvoke/Interop. Adam Nathan has written some great
information about that:
http://blogs.msdn.com/adam_nathan/
>> Does SOS support DML?
Yes.  SOS respects the .prefer_dml option in the debugger.  If this setting is
turned on, then SOS will output DML by default.  Alternatively, you may leave
it off and add /D to the beginning of a command to get DML based output for it.
Not all SOS commands support DML output.
COMMAND: stoponexception.
!StopOnException [-derived] 
                 [-create | -create2] 
                 <Exception> 
                 [<Pseudo-register number>]
!StopOnException helps when you want the Windows Debugger to stop on a 
particular managed exception, say a System.OutOfMemoryException, but continue
running if other exceptions are thrown. The command can be used in two ways:
1) When you just want to stop on one particular CLR exception
   At the debugger prompt, anytime after loading SOS, type:
   !StopOnException -create System.OutOfMemoryException 1
   The pseudo-register number (1) indicates that SOS can use register $t1 for
   maintaining the breakpoint. The -create parameter allows SOS to go ahead
   and set up the breakpoint as a first-chance exception. -create2 would set
   it up as a 2nd-chance exception. 
2) When you need more complex logic for stopping on a CLR exception
   !StopOnException can be used purely as a predicate in a larger expression.
   If you type:
   !StopOnException System.OutOfMemoryException 3
   then register $t3 will be set to 1 if the last thrown exception on the 
   current thread is a System.OutOfMemoryException. Otherwise, $t3 will be set
   to 0. Using the Windows Debugger scripting language, you could chain 
   such calls together to stop on various exception types. You'll have to 
   manually create such predicates, for example:
   sxe -c "!soe System.OutOfMemoryException 3; 
           !soe -derived System.IOException 4;
           .if(@$t3==1 || @$t4==1) { .echo 'stop' } .else {g}"
The -derived option will cause StopOnException to set the pseudo-register to
1 even if the thrown exception type doesn't exactly match the exception type
given, but merely derives from it. So, "-derived System.Exception" would catch
every exception in the System.Exception heirarchy.
The pseudo-register number is optional. If you don't pass a number, SOS will 
use pseudo-register $t1.
Note that !PrintException with no parameters will print out the last thrown
exception on the current thread (if any). You can use !soe as a shortcut for 
!StopOnException.
COMMAND: minidumpmode.
!MinidumpMode <0 or 1>
Minidumps created with ".dump /m" or ".dump" have a very small set of 
CLR-specific data, just enough to run a subset of SOS commands correctly. You 
are able to run other SOS commands, but they may fail with unexpected errors 
because required areas of memory are not mapped in or only partially mapped 
in. At this time, SOS cannot reliably detect if a dump file is of this type 
(for one thing, custom dump commands can map in additional memory, but there 
is no facility to read meta-information about this memory). You can turn this 
option on to protect against running unsafe commands against small minidumps.
By default, MinidumpMode is 0, so there is no restriction on commands that will
run against a minidump.
COMMAND: dumpobj.
!DumpObj [-nofields] <object address>
This command allows you to examine the fields of an object, as well as learn 
important properties of the object such as the EEClass, the MethodTable, and 
the size.
You might find an object pointer by running !DumpStackObjects and choosing
from the resultant list. Here is a simple object:
0:000> !DumpObj a79d40
Name: Customer
MethodTable: 009038ec
EEClass: 03ee1b84
Size: 20(0x14) bytes
 (C:\pub\unittest.exe)
Fields:
      MT    Field   Offset                 Type  VT     Attr    Value Name
009038ec  4000008        4             Customer   0 instance 00a79ce4 name
009038ec  4000009        8                 Bank   0 instance 00a79d2c bank
Note that fields of type Customer and Bank are themselves objects, and you can 
run !DumpObj on them too. You could look at the field directly in memory using
the offset given. "dd a79d40+8 l1" would allow you to look at the bank field 
directly. Be careful about using this to set memory breakpoints, since objects
can move around in the garbage collected heap.
What else can you do with an object? You might run !GCRoot, to determine what 
roots are keeping it alive. Or you can find all objects of that type with 
"!DumpHeap -type Customer".
The column VT contains the value 1 if the field is a valuetype structure, and
0 if the field contains a pointer to another object. For valuetypes, you can 
take the MethodTable pointer in the MT column, and the Value and pass them to 
the command !DumpVC.
The abbreviation !do can be used for brevity.
The arguments in detail:
-nofields:     do not print fields of the object, useful for objects like 
                  String
COMMAND: dumparray.
!DumpArray 
[-start <startIndex>]
[-length <length>]
[-details]
[-nofields]
<array object address>
This command allows you to examine elements of an array object.
The arguments in detail:
 -start <startIndex>: optional, only supported for single dimension array. 
                      Specify from which index the command shows the elements.
 -length <length>:    optional, only supported for single dimension array. 
                      Specify how many elements to show.
 -details:            optional. Ask the command to print out details
                      of the element using !DumpObj and !DumpVC format.
 -nofields:           optional, only takes effect when -details is used. Do
                      not print fields of the elements. Useful for arrays of
                      objects like String
 Example output:

COMMAND: dumpstackobjects.
!DumpStackObjects [-verify] [top stack [bottom stack]]
This command will display any managed objects it finds within the bounds of 
the current stack. Combined with the stack tracing commands like K and 
!CLRStack, it is a good aid to determining the values of locals and 
parameters.
If you use the -verify option, each non-static CLASS field of an object
candidate is validated. This helps to eliminate false positives. It is not
on by default because very often in a debugging scenario, you are 
interested in objects with invalid fields.
The abbreviation !dso can be used for brevity.
COMMAND: dumpheap.
!DumpHeap [-stat] 
          [-strings] 
          [-short]
          [-min <size>] 
          [-max <size>] 
          [-live]
          [-dead]
          [-thinlock] 
          [-startAtLowerBound]
          [-mt <MethodTable address>] 
          [-type <partial type name>] 
          [start [end]]
!DumpHeap is a powerful command that traverses the garbage collected heap, 
collection statistics about objects. With it's various options, it can look for
particular types, restrict to a range, or look for ThinLocks (see !SyncBlk 
documentation). Finally, it will provide a warning if it detects excessive 
fragmentation in the GC heap. 
When called without options, the output is first a list of objects in the heap,
followed by a report listing all the types found, their size and number:
0:000> !dumpheap

"Free" objects are simply regions of space the garbage collector can use later.
If 30% or more of the heap contains "Free" objects, the process may suffer from
heap fragmentation. This is usually caused by pinning objects for a long time 
combined with a high rate of allocation. Here is example output where !DumpHeap
provides a warning about fragmentation:
<After the Statistics section>

The arguments in detail:
-stat     Restrict the output to the statistical type summary
-strings  Restrict the output to a statistical string value summary
-short    Limits output to just the address of each object. This allows you
          to easily pipe output from the command to another debugger 
          command for automation.
-min      Ignore objects less than the size given in bytes
-max      Ignore objects larger than the size given in bytes
-live     Only print live objects
-dead     Only print dead objects (objects which will be collected in the
          next full GC)
-thinlock Report on any ThinLocks (an efficient locking scheme, see !SyncBlk 
          documentation for more info)
-startAtLowerBound 
          Force heap walk to begin at lower bound of a supplied address range.
          (During plan phase, the heap is often not walkable because objects 
          are being moved. In this case, DumpHeap may report spurious errors, 
          in particular bad objects. It may be possible to traverse more of 
          the heap after the reported bad object. Even if you specify an 
          address range, !DumpHeap will start its walk from the beginning of 
          the heap by default. If it finds a bad object before the specified 
          range, it will stop before displaying the part of the heap in which 
          you are interested. This switch will force !DumpHeap to begin its 
          walk at the specified lower bound. You must supply the address of a 
          good object as the lower bound for this to work. Display memory at 
          the address of the bad object to manually find the next method 
          table (use !dumpmt to verify). If the GC is currently in a call to 
          memcopy, You may also be able to find the next object's address by 
          adding the size to the start address given as parameters.) 
-mt       List only those objects with the MethodTable given
-type     List only those objects whose type name is a substring match of the 
          string provided. 
start     Begin listing from this address
end       Stop listing at this address
A special note about -type: Often, you'd like to find not only Strings, but
System.Object arrays that are constrained to contain Strings. ("new 
String[100]" actually creates a System.Object array, but it can only hold
System.String object pointers). You can use -type in a special way to find
these arrays. Just pass "-type System.String[]" and those Object arrays will
be returned. More generally, "-type <Substring of interesting type>[]".
The start/end parameters can be obtained from the output of !EEHeap -gc. For 
example, if you only want to list objects in the large heap segment:
0:000> !eeheap -gc

Finally, if GC heap corruption is present, you may see an error like this:

That indicates a serious problem. See the help for !VerifyHeap for more 
information on diagnosing the cause.
COMMAND: dumpvc.
!DumpVC <MethodTable address> <Address>
!DumpVC allows you to examine the fields of a value class. In C#, this is a 
struct, and lives on the stack or within an Object on the GC heap. You need
to know the MethodTable address to tell SOS how to interpret the fields, as
a value class is not a first-class object with it's own MethodTable as the
first field. For example:
0:000> !DumpObj a79d98
Name: Mainy
MethodTable: 009032d8
EEClass: 03ee1424
Size: 28(0x1c) bytes
 (C:\pub\unittest.exe)
Fields:
      MT    Field   Offset                 Type       Attr    Value Name
0090320c  4000010        4            VALUETYPE   instance 00a79d9c m_valuetype
009032d8  400000f        4                CLASS     static 00a79d54 m_sExcep
m_valuetype is a value type. The value in the MT column (0090320c) is the 
MethodTable for it, and the Value column provides the start address:
0:000> !DumpVC 0090320c 00a79d9c
Name: Funny
MethodTable 0090320c
EEClass: 03ee14b8
Size: 28(0x1c) bytes
 (C:\pub\unittest.exe)
Fields:
      MT    Field   Offset                 Type       Attr    Value Name
0090320c  4000001        0                CLASS   instance 00a743d8 signature
0090320c  4000002        8         System.Int32   instance     2345 m1
0090320c  4000003       10       System.Boolean   instance        1 b1
0090320c  4000004        c         System.Int32   instance     1234 m2
0090320c  4000005        4                CLASS   instance 00a79d98 backpointer
!DumpVC is quite a specialized function. Some managed programs make heavy use 
of value classes, while others do not.
COMMAND: gcroot.
!GCRoot [-nostacks] <Object address>
!GCRoot looks for references (or roots) to an object. These can exist in four
places:
   1. On the stack
   2. Within a GC Handle
   3. In an object ready for finalization
   4. As a member of an object found in 1, 2 or 3 above.
First, all stacks will be searched for roots, then handle tables, and finally
the freachable queue of the finalizer. Some caution about the stack roots: 
!GCRoot doesn't attempt to determine if a stack root it encountered is valid 
or is old (discarded) data. You would have to use !CLRStack and !U to 
disassemble the frame that the local or argument value belongs to in order to 
determine if it is still in use.
Because people often want to restrict the search to gc handles and freachable
objects, there is a -nostacks option.
COMMAND: objsize.
!ObjSize [<Object address>]
With no parameters, !ObjSize lists the size of all objects found on managed 
threads. It also enumerates all GCHandles in the process, and totals the size 
of any objects pointed to by those handles. In calculating object size, 
!ObjSize includes the size of all child objects in addition to the parent.
For example, !DumpObj lists a size of 20 bytes for this Customer object:
0:000> !do a79d40
Name: Customer
MethodTable: 009038ec
EEClass: 03ee1b84
Size: 20(0x14) bytes
 (C:\pub\unittest.exe)
Fields:
      MT    Field   Offset                 Type       Attr    Value Name
009038ec  4000008        4                CLASS   instance 00a79ce4 name
009038ec  4000009        8                CLASS   instance 00a79d2c bank
009038ec  400000a        c       System.Boolean   instance        1 valid
but !ObjSize lists 152 bytes:
0:000> !ObjSize a79d40
sizeof(00a79d40) =      152 (    0x98) bytes (Customer)
This is because a Customer points to a Bank, has a name, and the Bank points to
an Address string. You can use !ObjSize to identify any particularly large 
objects, such as a managed cache in a web server.
While running ObjSize with no arguments may point to specific roots that hold 
onto large amounts of memory it does not provide information regarding the 
amount of managed memory that is still alive.  This is due to the fact that a 
number of roots can share a common subgraph, and that part will be reported in 
the size of all the roots that reference the subgraph.
Please note the -aggregate parameter to !ObjSize has been removed.  Please see
'!DumpHeap -live' and '!DumpHeap -dead' for that functionality.
COMMAND: finalizequeue.
!FinalizeQueue [-detail] | [-allReady] [-short]
This command lists the objects registered for finalization. Here is output from
a simple program:
0:000> !finalizequeue
SyncBlocks to be cleaned up: 0
MTA Interfaces to be released: 0
STA Interfaces to be released: 1
generation 0 has 4 finalizable objects (0015bc90->0015bca0)
generation 1 has 0 finalizable objects (0015bc90->0015bc90)
generation 2 has 0 finalizable objects (0015bc90->0015bc90)
Ready for finalization 0 objects (0015bca0->0015bca0)
Statistics:
      MT    Count TotalSize Class Name
5ba6cf78        1        24 Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeFileHandle
5ba5db04        1        68 System.Threading.Thread
5ba73e28        2       112 System.IO.StreamWriter
Total 4 objects
The GC heap is divided into generations, and objects are listed accordingly. We
see that only generation 0 (the youngest generation) has any objects registered
for finalization. The notation "(0015bc90->0015bca0)" means that if you look at
memory in that range, you'll see the object pointers that are registered:
0:000> dd 15bc90 15bca0-4
0015bc90  00a743f4 00a79f00 00a7b3d8 00a7b47c
You could run !DumpObj on any of those pointers to learn more. In this example,
there are no objects ready for finalization, presumably because they still have
roots (You can use !GCRoot to find out). The statistics section provides a 
higher-level summary of the objects registered for finalization. Note that 
objects ready for finalization are also included in the statistics (if any).
Specifying -short will inhibit any display related to SyncBlocks or RCWs.
The arguments in detail:
-allReady Specifying this argument will allow for the display of all objects 
          that are ready for finalization, whether they are already marked by 
          the GC as such, or whether the next GC will.  The objects that are 
          not in the "Ready for finalization" list are finalizable objects that 
          are no longer rooted.  This option can be very expensive, as it 
          verifies whether all the objects in the finalizable queues are still 
          rooted or not.
-short    Limits the output to just the address of each object.  If used in 
          conjunction with -allReady it enumerates all objects that have a 
          finalizer that are no longer rooted.  If used independently it lists 
          all objects in the finalizable and "ready for finalization" queues.
-detail   Will display extra information on any SyncBlocks that need to be 
          cleaned up, and on any RuntimeCallableWrappers (RCWs) that await 
          cleanup.  Both of these data structures are cached and cleaned up by 
          the finalizer thread when it gets a chance to run.
COMMAND: printexception.
!PrintException [-nested] [-lines] [-ccw] [<Exception object address>] [<CCW pointer>]
This will format fields of any object derived from System.Exception. One of the
more useful aspects is that it will format the _stackTrace field, which is a 
binary array. If _stackTraceString field is not filled in, that can be helpful 
for debugging. You can of course use !DumpObj on the same exception object to 
explore more fields.
If called with no parameters, PrintException will look for the last outstanding 
exception on the current thread and print it. This will be the same exception
that shows up in a run of !Threads.
!PrintException will notify you if there are any nested exceptions on the 
current managed thread. (A nested exception occurs when you throw another
exception within a catch handler already being called for another exception).
If there are nested exceptions, you can re-run !PrintException with the 
"-nested" option to get full details on the nested exception objects. The
!Threads command will also tell you which threads have nested exceptions.
!PrintException can display source information if available, by specifying the 
-lines command line argument.
!PrintException prints the exception object corresponding to a given CCW pointer, 
which can be specified using the -ccw option. 
The abbreviation !pe can be used for brevity.
COMMAND: traverseheap.
!TraverseHeap [-xml] [-verify] <filename>
!TraverseHeap writes out a file in a format understood by the CLR Profiler. 
You can download the CLR Profiler from this link:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=86CE6052-D7F4-4AEB-
9B7A-94635BEEBDDA&displaylang=en
It creates a graphical display of the GC heap to help you analyze the state of
your application. 
If you pass the -verify option it will do more sanity checking of the heap
as it dumps it.   Use this option if heap corruption is suspected.
If you pass the "-xml" flag, the file is instead written out in an easy to 
understand xml format:
    <gcheap>
        <types>
            <type id="1" name="System.String">
            ...
        </types>
        <roots>
            <root kind="handle" address="0x00a73ff0"/>
            <root kind="stack" address="0x0069f0e0"/>
            ...
        </roots>
        <objects>
            <object address="0x00b73030" typeid="1" size="300"/>
            <object address="0x00b75054" typeid="5" size="20">
                <member address="0x00b75088" />
                ...
            </object>
            ...
        </objects>
    </gcheap>
You can break into your process, load SOS, take a snapshot of your heap with 
this function, then continue.
COMMAND: threadstate.
!ThreadState value
The !Threads command outputs, among other things, the state of the thread.
This is a bit field which corresponds to various states the thread is in.
To check the state of the thread, simply pass that bit field from the
output of !Threads into !ThreadState.
Example:
    0:003> !Threads
    ThreadCount:      2
    UnstartedThread:  0

COMMAND: threads.
!Threads [-live] [-special] 
!Threads lists all the mananaged threads in the process. 
-live:     optional. Only print threads associated with a live thread.
-special:  optional. With this switch, the command will display all the special
           threads created by CLR. Those threads might not be managed threads 
           so they might not be shown in the first part of the command's 
           output. Example of special threads include: GC threads (in 
           concurrent GC and server GC), Debugger helper threads, Finalizer 
           threads, AppDomain Unload threads, and Threadpool timer threads.
Each thread has many attributes, many of which can be ignored. The important 
ones are discussed below:
There are three ID columns: 
1) The debugger shorthand ID (When the runtime is hosted this column might 
   display the special string "<<<<" when this internal thread object is not 
   associated with any physical thread - this may happen when the host reuses
   the runtime internal thread object)
2) The CLR Thread ID
3) The OS thread ID.  
If PreEmptiveGC is enabled for a thread, then a garbage collection 
can occur while that thread is running. For example, if you break in while
a managed thread is making a PInvoke call to a Win32 function, that thread 
will be in PreEmptive GC mode. 
The Domain column indicates what AppDomain the thread is currently executing
in. You can pass this value to !DumpDomain to find out more. 
The APT column gives the COM apartment mode. 
Exception will list the last thrown exception (if any) for the thread. More
details can be obtained by passing the pointer value to !PrintException. If
you get the notation "(nested exceptions)", you can get details on those
exceptions by switching to the thread in question, and running 
"!PrintException -nested".
COMMAND: clrstack.
!CLRStack [-a] [-l] [-p] [-n]
!CLRStack [-a] [-l] [-p] [-i] [variable name] [frame]
CLRStack attempts to provide a true stack trace for managed code only. It is
handy for clean, simple traces when debugging straightforward managed 
programs. The -p parameter will show arguments to the managed function. The 
-l parameter can be used to show information on local variables in a frame.
SOS can't retrieve local names at this time, so the output for locals is in
the format <local address> = <value>. The -a (all) parameter is a short-cut
for -l and -p combined. 
If the debugger has the option SYMOPT_LOAD_LINES specified (either by the
.lines or .symopt commands), SOS will look up the symbols for every managed 
frame and if successful will display the corresponding source file name and 
line number. The -n (No line numbers) parameter can be specified to disable 
this behavior.
When you see methods with the name "[Frame:...", that indicates a transition 
between managed and unmanaged code. You could run !IP2MD on the return 
addresses in the call stack to get more information on each managed method.
On x64 platforms, Transition Frames are not displayed at this time. To avoid
heavy optimization of parameters and locals one can request the JIT compiler
to not optimize functions in the managed app by creating a file myapp.ini 
(if your program is myapp.exe) in the same directory. Put the following lines
in myapp.ini and re-run:
[.NET Framework Debugging Control]
GenerateTrackingInfo=1
AllowOptimize=0
The -i option is a new EXPERIMENTAL addition to CLRStack and will use the ICorDebug
interfaces to display the managed stack and variables. With this option you can also 
view and expand arrays and fields for managed variables. If a stack frame number is 
specified in the command line, CLRStack will show you the parameters and/or locals 
only for that frame (provided you specify -l or -p or -a of course). If a variable 
name and a stack frame number are specified in the command line, CLRStack will show 
you the parameters and/or locals for that frame, and will also show you the fields 
for that variable name you specified. Here are some examples: 
   !CLRStack -i -a           : This will show you all parameters and locals for all frames
   !CLRStack -i -a 3         : This will show you all parameters and locals, for frame 3
   !CLRStack -i var1 0       : This will show you the fields of 'var1' for frame 0
   !CLRStack -i var1.abc 2   : This will show you the fields of 'var1', and expand
                               'var1.abc' to show you the fields of the 'abc' field,
                               for frame 2.
   !CLRStack -i var1.[basetype] 0   : This will show you the fields of 'var1', and
                                      expand the base type of 'var1' to show you its
                                      fields.
   !CLRStack -i var1.[6] 0   : If 'var1' is an array, this will show you the element
                               at index 6 in the array, along with its fields
The -i options uses DML output for a better debugging experience, so typically you
should only need to execute "!CLRStack -i", and from there, click on the DML 
hyperlinks to inspect the different managed stack frames and managed variables.                             
COMMAND: ip2md.
!IP2MD <Code address>
Given an address in managed JITTED code, IP2MD attempts to find the MethodDesc
associated with it. For example, this output from K:

We have taken a return address into Mainy.Main, and discovered information 
about that method. You could run !U, !DumpMT, !DumpClass, !DumpMD, or 
!DumpModule on the fields listed to learn more.
The "Source line" output will only be present if the debugger can find the 
symbols for the managed module containing the given <code address>, and if the 
debugger is configured to load line number information.
COMMAND: u.
!U [-gcinfo] [-ehinfo] [-n] <MethodDesc address> | <Code address>
Presents an annotated disassembly of a managed method when given a MethodDesc
pointer for the method, or a code address within the method body. Unlike the
debugger "U" function, the entire method from start to finish is printed,
with annotations that convert metadata tokens to names.
<example output>
03ef015d b901000000       mov     ecx,0x1
03ef0162 ff156477a25b     call   dword ptr [mscorlib_dll+0x3c7764 (5ba27764)] (System.Console.InitializeStdOutError(Boolean), mdToken: 06000713)

03ef016d 89442414         mov     [esp+0x14],eax
If you pass the -gcinfo flag, you'll get inline display of the GCInfo for
the method. You can also obtain this information with the !GCInfo command.
If you pass the -ehinfo flag, you'll get inline display of exception info
for the method. (Beginning and end of try/finally/catch handlers, etc.).
You can also obtain this information with the !EHInfo command.
If the debugger has the option SYMOPT_LOAD_LINES specified (either by the
.lines or .symopt commands), and if symbols are available for the managed
module containing the method being examined, the output of the command will
include the source file name and line number corresponding to the 
disassembly. The -n (No line numbers) flag can be specified to disable this
behavior.

COMMAND: dumpstack.
!DumpStack [-EE] [-n] [top stack [bottom stack]]
[x86 and x64 documentation]
This command provides a verbose stack trace obtained by "scraping." Therefore
the output is very noisy and potentially confusing. The command is good for
viewing the complete call stack when "kb" gets confused. For best results,
make sure you have valid symbols.
-EE will only show managed functions.
If the debugger has the option SYMOPT_LOAD_LINES specified (either by the
.lines or .symopt commands), SOS will look up the symbols for every managed 
frame and if successful will display the corresponding source file name and 
line number. The -n (No line numbers) parameter can be specified to disable 
this behavior.
You can also pass a stack range to limit the output. Use the debugger 
extension !teb to get the top and bottom stack values.
COMMAND: eestack.
!EEStack [-short] [-EE]
This command runs !DumpStack on all threads in the process. The -EE option is 
passed directly to !DumpStack. The -short option tries to narrow down the 
output to "interesting" threads only, which is defined by
1) The thread has taken a lock.
2) The thread has been "hijacked" in order to allow a garbage collection.
3) The thread is currently in managed code.
See the documentation for !DumpStack for more info.
COMMAND: ehinfo.
!EHInfo (<MethodDesc address> | <Code address>)
!EHInfo shows the exception handling blocks in a jitted method. For each 
handler, it shows the type, including code addresses and offsets for the clause
block and the handler block. For a TYPED handler, this would be the "try" and
"catch" blocks respectively.

COMMAND: gcinfo.
!GCInfo (<MethodDesc address> | <Code address>)
!GCInfo is especially useful for CLR Devs who are trying to determine if there 
is a bug in the JIT Compiler. It parses the GCEncoding for a method, which is a
compressed stream of data indicating when registers or stack locations contain 
managed objects. It is important to keep track of this information, because if 
a garbage collection occurs, the collector needs to know where roots are so it 
can update them with new object pointer values.
Here is sample output where you can see the change in register state. Normally 
you would print this output out and read it alongside a disassembly of the 
method. For example, the notation "reg EDI becoming live" at offset 0x11 of the
method might correspond to a "mov edi,ecx" statement.

This function is important for CLR Devs, but very difficult for anyone else to 
make sense of it. You would usually come to use it if you suspect a gc heap 
corruption bug caused by invalid GCEncoding for a particular method.
COMMAND: comstate.
!COMState
!COMState lists the com apartment model for each thread, as well as a Context 
pointer if provided.
COMMAND: bpmd.
!BPMD [-nofuturemodule] <module name> <method name> [<il offset>]
!BPMD <source file name>:<line number>
!BPMD -md <MethodDesc>
!BPMD -list
!BPMD -clear <pending breakpoint number>
!BPMD -clearall
!BPMD provides managed breakpoint support. If it can resolve the method name
to a loaded, jitted or ngen'd function it will create a breakpoint with "bp".
If not then either the module that contains the method hasn't been loaded yet
or the module is loaded, but the function is not jitted yet. In these cases,
!bpmd asks the Windows Debugger to receive CLR Notifications, and waits to
receive news of module loads and JITs, at which time it will try to resolve 
the function to a breakpoint. -nofuturemodule can be used to suppress 
creating a breakpoint against a module that has not yet been loaded.
Management of the list of pending breakpoints can be done via !BPMD -list,
!BPMD -clear, and !BPMD -clearall commands. !BPMD -list generates a list of 
all of the pending breakpoints. If the pending breakpoint has a non-zero 
module id, then that pending breakpoint is specific to function in that 
particular loaded module. If the pending breakpoint has a zero module id, then
the breakpoint applies to modules that have not yet been loaded. Use 
!BPMD -clear or !BPMD -clearall to remove pending breakpoints from the list.
This brings up a good question: "I want to set a breakpoint on the main
method of my application. How can I do this?"
  1) If you know the full path to SOS, use this command and skip to step 6
       .load <the full path to sos.dll>
  2) If you don't know the full path to sos, its usually next to clr.dll
     You can wait for clr to load and then find it.
     Start the debugger and type: 
       sxe -c "" clrn
  3) g
  4) You'll get the following notification from the debugger:
     "CLR notification: module 'mscorlib' loaded"
  5) Now you can load SOS. Type
       .loadby sos clr
  6) Add the breakpoint with command such as:
       !bpmd myapp.exe MyApp.Main
  7) g
  8) You will stop at the start of MyApp.Main. If you type "bl" you will 
     see the breakpoint listed.
You can specify breakpoints by file and line number if:
   a) You have some version of .Net Framework installed on your machine. Any OS from
      Vista onwards should have .Net Framework installed by default.
   b) You have PDBs for the managed modules that need breakpoints, and your symbol
      path points to those PDBs.
This is often easier than module and method name syntax. For example:
   !bpmd Demo.cs:15
To correctly specify explicitly implemented methods make sure to retrieve the
method name from the metadata, or from the output of the "!dumpmt -md" command. 
For example:
public interface I1
    void M1();
public class ExplicitItfImpl : I1
    ...
    void I1.M1()
// this method's name is 'I1.M1'
    { ... }
!bpmd myapp.exe ExplicitItfImpl.I1.M1
!BPMD works equally well with generic types. Adding a breakpoint on a generic 
type sets breakpoints on all already JIT-ted generic methods and sets a pending 
breakpoint for any instantiation that will be JIT-ted in the future.
Example for generics:
Given the following two classes:
class G3<T1, T2, T3> 
public void F(T1 p1, T2 p2, T3 p3)
{ ... }
public class G1<T> {
// static method
static public void G<W>(W w)
{ ... }
One would issue the following commands to set breapoints on G3.F() and 
G1.G():
!bpmd myapp.exe G3`3.F
!bpmd myapp.exe G1`1.G
And for explicitly implemented methods on generic interfaces:
public interface IT1<T>
    void M1(T t);
public class ExplicitItfImpl<U> : IT1<U>
    ...
    void IT1<U>.M1(U u)
// this method's name is 'IT1<U>.M1'
    { ... }
!bpmd bpmd.exe ExplicitItfImpl`1.IT1<U>.M1
Additional examples:
If IT1 and ExplicitItfImpl are types declared inside another class, 
Outer, the bpmd command would become:
!bpmd bpmd.exe Outer+ExplicitItfImpl`1.Outer.IT1<U>.M1
(note that the fully qualified type name for ExplicitItfImpl became
Outer+ExplicitItfImpl, using the '+' separator, while the method name
is Outer.IT1<U>.M1, using a '.' as the separator)
Furthermore, if the Outer class resides in a namespace, NS, the bpmd 
command to use becomes:
!bpmd bpmd.exe NS.Outer+ExplicitItfImpl`1.NS.Outer.IT1<U>.M1
!BPMD does not accept offsets nor parameters in the method name. You can add
an IL offset as an optional parameter seperate from the name. If there are overloaded
methods, !bpmd will set a breakpoint for all of them.
In the case of hosted environments such as SQL, the module name may be 
complex, like 'price, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'.
For this case, just be sure to surround the module name with single quotes,
like:
!bpmd 'price, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' Price.M2
COMMAND: dumpdomain.
!DumpDomain [<Domain address>]
When called with no parameters, !DumpDomain will list all the AppDomains in the
process. It enumerates each Assembly loaded into those AppDomains as well. 
In addition to your application domain, and any domains it might create, there
are two special domains: the Shared Domain and the System Domain.
Any Assembly pointer in the output can be passed to !DumpAssembly. Any Module 
pointer in the output can be passed to !DumpModule. Any AppDomain pointer can 
be passed to !DumpDomain to limit output only to that AppDomain. Other 
functions provide an AppDomain pointer as well, such as !Threads where it lists
the current AppDomain for each thread.
COMMAND: eeheap.
!EEHeap [-gc] [-loader]
!EEHeap enumerates process memory consumed by internal CLR data structures. You
can limit the output by passing "-gc" or "-loader". All information will be 
displayed otherwise.
The information for the Garbage Collector lists the ranges of each Segment in 
the managed heap. This can be useful if you believe you have an object pointer.
If the pointer falls within a segment range given by "!EEHeap -gc", then you do
have an object pointer, and can attempt to run "!DumpObj" on it.
Here is output for a simple program:
0:000> !eeheap -gc
Number of GC Heaps: 1
generation 0 starts at 0x00a71018
generation 1 starts at 0x00a7100c
generation 2 starts at 0x00a71000
 segment    begin allocated     size
00a70000 00a71000  00a7e01c 0000d01c(53276)
Large object heap starts at 0x01a71000
 segment    begin allocated     size
01a70000 01a71000  01a76000 0x00005000(20480)
Total Size   0x1201c(73756)
------------------------------
GC Heap Size   0x1201c(73756)
So the total size of the GC Heap is only 72K. On a large web server, with 
multiple processors, you can expect to see a GC Heap of 400MB or more. The 
Garbage Collector attempts to collect and reclaim memory only when required to
by memory pressure for better performance. You can also see the notion of 
"generations," wherein the youngest objects live in generation 0, and 
long-lived objects eventually get "promoted" to generation 2.
The loader output lists various private heaps associated with AppDomains. It 
also lists heaps associated with the JIT compiler, and heaps associated with 
Modules. For example:

By using !EEHeap to keep track of the growth of these private heaps, we are 
able to rule out or include them as a source of a memory leak.
COMMAND: name2ee.
!Name2EE <module name> <type or method name>
!Name2EE <module name>!<type or method name>
This function allows you to turn a class name into a MethodTable and EEClass. 
It turns a method name into a MethodDesc. Here is an example for a method:
0:000> !name2ee unittest.exe MainClass.Main
Module: 001caa38
Token: 0x0600000d
MethodDesc: 00902f40
Name: MainClass.Main()
JITTED Code Address: 03ef00b8
and for a class:
0:000> !name2ee unittest!MainClass
Module: 001caa38
Token: 0x02000005
MethodTable: 009032d8
EEClass: 03ee1424
Name: MainClass
The module you are "browsing" with Name2EE needs to be loaded in the process. 
To get a type name exactly right, first browse the module with ILDASM. You
can also pass * as the <module name> to search all loaded managed modules.
<module name> can also be the debugger's name for a module, such as
mscorlib or image00400000.
The Windows Debugger syntax of <module>!<type> is also supported. You can
use an asterisk on the left of the !, but the type on the right side needs
to be fully qualified.
If you are looking for a way to display a static field of a class (and you
don't have an instance of the class, so !dumpobj won't help you), note that
once you have the EEClass, you can run !DumpClass, which will display the
value of all static fields.
There is yet one more way to specify a module name. In the case of modules
loaded from an assembly store (such as a SQL db) rather than disk, the
module name will look like this:
price, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null
For this kind of module, simply use price as the module name:
0:044> !name2ee price Price
Module: 10f028b0 (price, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null)
Token: 0x02000002
MethodTable: 11a47ae0
EEClass: 11a538c8
Name: Price
Where are we getting these module names from? Run !DumpDomain to see a list of
all loaded modules in all domains. And remember that you can browse all the
types in a module with !DumpModule -mt <module pointer>.
COMMAND: syncblk.
!SyncBlk [-all | <syncblk number>]
A SyncBlock is a holder for extra information that doesn't need to be created 
for every object. It can hold COM Interop data, HashCodes, and locking 
information for thread-safe operations.
When called without arguments, !SyncBlk will print the list of SyncBlocks 
corresponding to objects that are owned by a thread. For example, a
    lock(MyObject)
    {
        ....
    }
statement will set MyObject to be owned by the current thread. A SyncBlock will
be created for MyObject, and the thread ownership information stored there 
(this is an oversimplification, see NOTE below). If another thread tries to 
execute the same code, they won't be able to enter the block until the first 
thread exits.
This makes !SyncBlk useful for detecting managed deadlocks. Consider that the
following code is executed by Threads A & B:
    Resource r1 = new Resource();
    Resource r2 = new Resource();
    ...
    lock(r1)                             lock(r2)
    {                                    {
        lock(r2)                             lock(r1)
        {                                    {
            ...                                  ...
        }                                    }
    }                                    }
This is a deadlock situation, as Thread A could take r1, and Thread B r2, 
leaving both threads with no option but to wait forever in the second lock 
statement. !SyncBlk will detect this with the following output:
0:003> !syncblk
Index SyncBlock MonitorHeld Recursion Owning Thread Info   SyncBlock Owner
  238 001e40ec            3         1 001e4e60   e04   3   00a7a194 Resource

It means that Thread e04 owns object 00a7a194, and Thread ab8 owns object 
00a7a1a4. Combine that information with the call stacks of the deadlock:

By looking at the code corresponding to Worker.Work()+0x79 (run "!u 03f00229"),
you can see that thread 3 is attempting to acquire the Resource 00a7a1a4, which
is owned by thread 4.
NOTE:
It is not always the case that a SyncBlock will be created for every object 
that is locked by a thread. In version 2.0 of the CLR and above, a mechanism 
called a ThinLock will be used if there is not already a SyncBlock for the 
object in question. ThinLocks will not be reported by the !SyncBlk command. 
You can use "!DumpHeap -thinlock" to list objects locked in this way.
COMMAND: dumpmt.
!DumpMT [-MD] <MethodTable address>
Examine a MethodTable. Each managed object has a MethodTable pointer at the 
start. If you pass the "-MD" flag, you'll also see a list of all the methods 
defined on the object. 
COMMAND: dumpclass.
!DumpClass <EEClass address>
The EEClass is a data structure associated with an object type. !DumpClass 
will show attributes, as well as list the fields of the type. The output is 
similar to !DumpObj. Although static field values will be displayed, 
non-static values won't because you need an instance of an object for that.
You can get an EEClass to look at from !DumpMT, !DumpObj, !Name2EE, and 
!Token2EE among others.
COMMAND: dumpmd.
!DumpMD <MethodDesc address>
This command lists information about a MethodDesc. You can use !IP2MD to turn 
a code address in a managed function into a MethodDesc:
0:000> !dumpmd 902f40
Method Name: Mainy.Main()
Class: 03ee1424
MethodTable: 009032d8
mdToken: 0600000d
Module: 001caa78
IsJitted: yes
CodeAddr: 03ef00b8
If IsJitted is "yes," you can run !U on the CodeAddr pointer to see a 
disassembly of the JITTED code. You can also call !DumpClass, !DumpMT, 
!DumpModule on the Class, MethodTable and Module fields above.
COMMAND: token2ee.
!Token2EE <module name> <token>
This function allows you to turn a metadata token into a MethodTable or 
MethodDesc. Here is an example showing class tokens being resolved:
0:000> !token2ee unittest.exe 02000003
Module: 001caa38
Token: 0x02000003
MethodTable: 0090375c
EEClass: 03ee1ae0
Name: Bank
0:000> !token2ee image00400000 02000004
Module: 001caa38
Token: 0x02000004
MethodTable: 009038ec
EEClass: 03ee1b84
Name: Customer
The module you are "browsing" with Token2EE needs to be loaded in the process. 
This function doesn't see much use, especially since a tool like ILDASM can 
show the mapping between metadata tokens and types/methods in a friendlier way. 
But it could be handy sometimes.
You can pass "*" for <module name> to find what that token maps to in every
loaded managed module. <module name> can also be the debugger's name for a 
module, such as mscorlib or image00400000.
COMMAND: eeversion.
!EEVersion
This prints the Common Language Runtime version. It also tells you if the code 
is running in "Workstation" or "Server" mode, a distinction which affects the 
garbage collector. The most apparent difference in the debugger is that in 
"Server" mode there is one dedicated garbage collector thread per CPU.
A handy supplement to this function is to also run "lm v m clr". That 
will provide more details about the CLR, including where clr.dll is 
loaded from.
COMMAND: dumpmodule.
!DumpModule [-mt] <Module address>
You can get a Module address from !DumpDomain, !DumpAssembly and other 
functions. Here is sample output:
0:000> !DumpModule 1caa50
Name: C:\pub\unittest.exe
Attributes: PEFile
Assembly: 001ca248
LoaderHeap: 001cab3c
TypeDefToMethodTableMap: 03ec0010
TypeRefToMethodTableMap: 03ec0024
MethodDefToDescMap: 03ec0064
FieldDefToDescMap: 03ec00a4
MemberRefToDescMap: 03ec00e8
FileReferencesMap: 03ec0128
AssemblyReferencesMap: 03ec012c
MetaData start address: 00402230 (1888 bytes)
The Maps listed map metadata tokens to CLR data structures. Without going into 
too much detail, you can examine memory at those addresses to find the 
appropriate structures. For example, the TypeDefToMethodTableMap above can be 
examined:
0:000> dd 3ec0010
03ec0010  00000000 00000000 0090320c 0090375c
03ec0020  009038ec ...
This means TypeDef token 2 maps to a MethodTable with the value 0090320c. You 
can run !DumpMT to verify that. The MethodDefToDescMap takes a MethodDef token 
and maps it to a MethodDesc, which can be passed to !DumpMD.
There is a new option "-mt", which will display the types defined in a module,
and the types referenced by the module. For example:
0:000> !dumpmodule -mt 1aa580
Name: C:\pub\unittest.exe
...<etc>...
MetaData start address: 0040220c (1696 bytes)

COMMAND: dumpsig.
!DumpSig <sigaddr> <moduleaddr>
This command dumps the signature of a method or field given by <sigaddr>.  This is
useful when you are debugging parts of the runtime which returns a raw PCCOR_SIGNATURE
structure and need to know what its contents are.
Sample output for a method:
    0:000> !dumpsig 0x000007fe`ec20879d 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    [DEFAULT] [hasThis] Void (Boolean,String,String)
The first section of the output is the calling convention.  This includes, but is not
limited to, "[DEFAULT]", "[C]", "[STDCALL]", "[THISCALL]", and so on.  The second
portion of the output is either "[hasThis]" or "[explicit]" for whether the method
is an instance method or a static method respectively.  The third portion of the 
output is the return value (in this case a "void").  Finally, the method's arguments
are printed as the final portion of the output.
Sample output for a field:
    0:000> !dumpsig 0x000007fe`eb7fd8cd 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    [FIELD] ValueClass System.RuntimeTypeHandle 
!DumpSig will also work with generics.  Here is the output for the following
function:
    public A Test(IEnumerable<B> n)
    0:000> !dumpsig 00000000`00bc2437 000007ff00043178 
    [DEFAULT] [hasThis] __Canon (Class System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1<__Canon>)
COMMAND: dumpsigelem.
!DumpSigElem <sigaddr> <moduleaddr>
This command dumps a single element of a signature object.  For most circumstances,
you should use !DumpSig to look at individual signature objects, but if you find a 
signature that has been corrupted in some manner you can use !DumpSigElem to read out 
the valid portions of it.
If we look at a valid signature object for a method we see the following:
    0:000> !dumpsig 0x000007fe`ec20879d 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    [DEFAULT] [hasThis] Void (Boolean,String,String)
We can look at the individual elements of this object by adding the offsets into the 
object which correspond to the return value and parameters:
    0:000> !dumpsigelem 0x000007fe`ec20879d+2 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    Void
    0:000> !dumpsigelem 0x000007fe`ec20879d+3 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    Boolean
    0:000> !dumpsigelem 0x000007fe`ec20879d+4 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    String
    0:000> !dumpsigelem 0x000007fe`ec20879d+5 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    String
We can do something similar for fields.  Here is the full signature of a field:
    0:000> !dumpsig 0x000007fe`eb7fd8cd 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    [FIELD] ValueClass System.RuntimeTypeHandle 
Using !DumpSigElem we can find the type of the field by adding the offset of it (1) to 
the address of the signature:
    0:000> !dumpsigelem 0x000007fe`eb7fd8cd+1 0x000007fe`eabd1000
    ValueClass System.RuntimeTypeHandle
!DumpSigElem will also work with generics.  Let a function be defined as follows:
    public A Test(IEnumerable<B> n)
The elements of this signature can be obtained by adding offsets into the signature
when calling !DumpSigElem:
    0:000> !dumpsigelem 00000000`00bc2437+2 000007ff00043178 
    __Canon
    0:000> !dumpsigelem 00000000`00bc2437+4 000007ff00043178 
    Class System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1<__Canon>
The actual offsets that you should add are determined by the contents of the
signature itself.  By trial and error you should be able to find various elements
of the signature.
COMMAND: rcwcleanuplist.
!RCWCleanupList [address]
A RuntimeCallableWrapper is an internal CLR structure used to host COM objects
which are exposed to managed code.  This is exposed to managed code through the
System.__ComObject class, and when objects of this type are collected, and a
reference to the underlying COM object is no longer needed, the corresponding
RCW is cleaned up.  If you are trying to debug an issue related to one of these
RCWs, then you can use the !RCWCleanupList function to display which COM objects
will be released the next time a cleanup occurs.
If given an address, this function will display the RCWCleanupList at that address.
If no address is specified, it displays the default cleanup list, printing the
wrapper, the context, and the thread of the object.
Example:
    0:002> !rcwcleanuplist 001c04d0 
    RuntimeCallableWrappers (RCW) to be cleaned:
         RCW  CONTEXT   THREAD Apartment
      1d54e0   192008   181180       STA
      1d4140   192178        0       MTA
      1dff50   192178        0       MTA
    MTA Interfaces to be released: 2
    STA Interfaces to be released: 1
Note that CLR keeps track of which RCWs are bound to which managed objects through
the SyncBlock of the object.  As such, you can see more information about RCW
objects through the !SyncBlk command.  You can find more information about RCW
cleanup through the !FinalizeQueue command.
COMMAND: dumpil.
!DumpIL <Managed DynamicMethod object> | 
        <DynamicMethodDesc pointer> |
        <MethodDesc pointer> |
        /i <IL pointer>
!DumpIL prints the IL code associated with a managed method. We added this
function specifically to debug DynamicMethod code which was constructed on
the fly. Happily it works for non-dynamic code as well.
You can use it in four ways: 
  1) If you have a System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod object, just pass
     the pointer as the first argument. 
  2) If you have a DynamicMethodDesc pointer you can use that to print the
     IL associated with the dynamic method.
  3) If you have an ordinary MethodDesc, you can see the IL for that as well,
     just pass it as the first argument.
  4) If you have a pointer directly to the IL, specify /i followed by the
     the IL address.  This is useful for writers of profilers that instrument
     IL.
     
Note that dynamic IL is constructed a bit differently. Rather than referring
to metadata tokens, the IL points to objects in a managed object array. Here
is a simple example of the output for a dynamic method:
  0:000> !dumpil b741dc
  This is dynamic IL. Exception info is not reported at this time.
  If a token is unresolved, run "!do <addr>" on the addr given
  in parenthesis. You can also look at the token table yourself, by
  running "!DumpArray 00b77388".

COMMAND: verifyheap.
!VerifyHeap
!VerifyHeap is a diagnostic tool that checks the garbage collected heap for 
signs of corruption. It walks objects one by one in a pattern like this:
    o = firstobject;
    while(o != endobject)
    {
        o.ValidateAllFields();
        o = (Object *) o + o.Size();
    }
If an error is found, !VerifyHeap will report it. I'll take a perfectly good 
object and corrupt it:

If this gc heap corruption exists, there is a serious bug in your own code or 
in the CLR. In user code, an error in constructing PInvoke calls can cause 
this problem, and running with Managed Debugging Assistants is advised. If that
possibility is eliminated, consider contacting Microsoft Product Support for
help.
COMMAND: verifyobj.
!VerifyObj <object address>
!VerifyObj is a diagnostic tool that checks the object that is passed as an 
argument for signs of corruption.
0:002> !verifyobj 028000ec
object 0x28000ec does not have valid method table
0:002> !verifyobj 0680017c 
object 0x680017c: bad member 00000001 at 06800184
COMMAND: findroots.
!FindRoots -gen <N> | -gen any | <object address>
The "-gen" form causes the debugger to break in the debuggee on the next 
collection of the specified generation.  The effect is reset as soon as the 
break occurs, in other words, if you need to break on the next collection you 
would need to reissue the command.
The last form of this command is meant to be used after the break caused by the 
other forms has occurred.  Now the debuggee is in the right state for 
!FindRoots to be able to identify roots for objects from the current condemned 
generations.
!FindRoots is a diagnostic command that is meant to answer the following 
question:
"I see that GCs are happening, however my objects have still not been 
collected. Why? Who is holding onto them?"
The process of answering the question would go something like this:
1. Find out the generation of the object of interest using the !GCWhere 
command, say it is gen 1:
!GCWhere <object address>
2. Instruct the runtime to stop the next time it collects that generation using 
the !FindRoots command:
!FindRoots -gen 1
3. When the next GC starts, and has proceeded past the mark phase a CLR 
notification will cause a break in the debugger:
(fd0.ec4): CLR notification exception - code e0444143 (first chance)
CLR notification: GC - end of mark phase.
Condemned generation: 1.
4. Now we can use the !FindRoots <object address> to find out the cross 
generational references to the object of interest.  In other words, even if the 
object is not referenced by any "proper" root it may still be referenced by an 
older object (from an older generation), from a generation that has not yet been 
scheduled for collection.  At this point !FindRoots will search those older 
generations too, and report those roots.
0:002> !findroots 06808094 
older generations::Root:  068012f8(AAA.Test+a)->
  06808094(AAA.Test+b)
COMMAND: heapstat.
!HeapStat [-inclUnrooted | -iu]
This command shows the generation sizes for each heap and the total, how much free 
space there is in each generation on each heap.  If the -inclUnrooted option is
specified the report will include information about the managed objects from the
GC heap that are not rooted anymore.

COMMAND: analyzeoom.
!AnalyzeOOM
!AnalyzeOOM displays the info of the last OOM occured on an allocation request to
the GC heap (in Server GC it displays OOM, if any, on each GC heap). 
To see the managed exception(s) use the !Threads command which will show you 
managed exception(s), if any, on each managed thread. If you do see an 
OutOfMemoryException exception you can use the !PrintException command on it.
To get the full callstack use the "kb" command in the debugger for that thread.
For example, to display thread 3's stack use ~3kb.
OOM exceptions could be because of the following reasons:
1) allocation request to GC heap 
   in which case you will see JIT_New* on the call stack because managed code called new.
2) other runtime allocation failure
   for example, failure to expand the finalize queue when GC.ReRegisterForFinalize is
   called.
3) some other code you use throws a managed OOM exception 
   for example, some .NET framework code converts a native OOM exception to managed 
   and throws it.
The !AnalyzeOOM command aims to help you with investigating 1) which is the most
difficult because it requires some internal info from GC. The only exception is
we don't support allocating objects larger than 2GB on CLR v2.0 or prior. And this
command will not display any managed OOM because we will throw OOM right away 
instead of even trying to allocate it on the GC heap.
There are 2 legitimate scenarios where GC would return OOM to allocation requests - 
one is if the process is running out of VM space to reserve a segment; the other
is if the system is running out physical memory (+ page file if you have one) so
GC can not commit memory it needs. You can look at these scenarios by using performance
counters or debugger commands. For example for the former scenario the "!address 
-summary" debugger command will show you the largest free region in the VM. For
the latter scenario you can look at the "Memory\% Committed Bytes In Use" see
if you are running low on commit space. One important thing to keep in mind is
when you do this kind of memory analysis it could an aftereffect and doesn't 
completely agree with what this command tells you, in which case the command should
be respected because it truly reflects what happened during GC.
The other cases should be fairly obvious from the callstack.
Sample output:

COMMAND: gcwhere.
!GCWhere <object address>
!GCWhere displays the location in the GC heap of the argument passed in.
0:002> !GCWhere 02800038  
Address  Gen Heap segment  begin    allocated size
02800038 2    0   02800000 02800038 0282b740  12
When the argument lies in the managed heap, but is not a valid *object* address 
the "size" is displayed as 0:
0:002> !GCWhere 0280003c

COMMAND: listnearobj.
!ListNearObj <object address>
!ListNearObj is a diagnostic tool that displays the object preceeding and 
succeeding the address passed in:
The command looks for the address in the GC heap that looks like a valid 
beginning of a managed object (based on a valid method table) and the object 
following the argument address.
0:002> !ListNearObj 028000ec
Before: 0x28000a4           72 (0x48      ) System.StackOverflowException
After:  0x2800134           72 (0x48      ) System.Threading.ThreadAbortException
Heap local consistency confirmed.
0:002> !ListNearObj 028000f0

After:  0x2800134           72 (0x48      ) System.Threading.ThreadAbortException
Heap local consistency confirmed.
The command considers the heap as "locally consistent" if:
prev_obj_addr + prev_obj_size = arg_addr && arg_obj + arg_size = next_obj_addr
prev_obj_addr + prev_obj_size = next_obj_addr
When the condition is not satisfied:
0:002> !lno 028000ec
Before: 0x28000a4           72 (0x48      ) System.StackOverflowException
After:  0x2800134           72 (0x48      ) System.Threading.ThreadAbortException
Heap local consistency not confirmed.
COMMAND: dumplog.
!DumpLog [-addr <addressOfStressLog>] [<Filename>]
To aid in diagnosing hard-to-reproduce stress failures, the CLR team added an 
in-memory log capability. The idea was to avoid using locks or I/O which could 
disturb a fragile repro environment. The !DumpLog function allows you to write 
that log out to a file. If no Filename is specified, the file "Stresslog.txt" 
in the current directory is created.
The optional argument addr allows one to specify a stress log other then the 
default one.
0:000> !DumpLog
Attempting to dump Stress log to file 'StressLog.txt'
.................
SUCCESS: Stress log dumped
To turn on the stress log, set the following registry keys under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework:
(DWORD) StressLog = 1
(DWORD) LogFacility = 0xffffffbf (this is a bit mask, almost all logging is on.
                                  This is also the default value if the key 
                                  isn't specified)
(DWORD) StressLogSize = 65536    (this is the default value if the key isn't
                                  specified)
(DWORD) LogLevel = 6             (this is the default value if the key isn't
                                  specified.  The higher the number the more
                                  detailed logs are generated.  The maximum 
                                  value is decimal 10)
StressLogSize is the size in bytes of the in-memory log allocated for each 
thread in the process. In the case above, each thread gets a 64K log. You 
could increase this to get more logging, but more memory will be required for 
this log in the process. For example, 20 threads with 524288 bytes per thread 
has a memory demand of 10 Megabytes. The stress log is circular so new entries 
will replace older ones on threads which have reached their buffer limit.
The log facilities are defined as follows:

The first column is the OS thread ID for the thread appending to the log, 
the second column is the timestamp, the third is the facility category for the 
log entry, and the fourth contains the log message. The facility field is 
expressed as `facility1`facility2`facility3`.  This facilitates the creation of 
filters for displaying only specific message categories.  To make sense of this 
log, you would probably want the Shared Source CLI to find out exactly where 
the log comes from.
COMMAND: findappdomain.
!FindAppDomain <Object address>
!FindAppDomain will attempt to resolve the AppDomain of an object. For example,
using an Object Pointer from the output of !DumpStackObjects:
0:000> !findappdomain 00a79d98
AppDomain: 0014f000
Name: unittest.exe
ID: 1
You can find out more about the AppDomain with the !DumpDomain command. Not 
every object has enough clues about it's origin to determine the AppDomain. 
Objects with Finalizers are the easiest case, as the CLR needs to be able to 
call those when an AppDomain shuts down.
COMMAND: savemodule.
!SaveModule <Base address> <Filename>
This command allows you to take a image loaded in memory and write it to a 
file. This is especially useful if you are debugging a full memory dump, and 
don't have the original DLLs or EXEs. This is most often used to save a managed
binary to a file, so you can disassemble the code and browse types with ILDASM.
The base address of an image can be found with the "LM" debugger command:
0:000> lm
start    end        module name
00400000 00408000   image00400000     (deferred)

5d1d0000 5e13c000   clr     (deferred)
If I wanted to save a copy of clr.dll, I could run:
0:000> !SaveModule 5d1d0000 c:\pub\out.tmp

section 3 - VA=eaa000, VASize=c183c, FileAddr=e92400, FileSize=c1a00
The diagnostic output indicates that the operation was successful. If 
c:\pub\out.tmp already exists, it will be overwritten.
COMMAND: gchandles.
!GCHandles [-type handletype] [-stat] [-perdomain]
!GCHandles provides statistics about GCHandles in the process.
Paremeters:
    stat - Only display the statistics and not the list of handles and
           what they point to.
    perdomain - Break down the statistics by the app domain in which
                the handles reside.
    type - A type of handle to filter it by.  The handle types are:
           Pinned
           RefCounted
           WeakShort
           WeakLong
           Strong
           Variable
           AsyncPinned
           SizedRef
Sometimes the  source of a memory leak is a GCHandle leak. For example, code
might keep a 50 Megabyte array alive because a strong GCHandle points to it,
and the handle was discarded without freeing it.
The most common handles are "Strong Handles," which keep the object they point 
to alive until the handle is explicitly freed. "Pinned Handles" are used to 
prevent the garbage collector from moving an object during collection. These 
should be used sparingly, and for short periods of time. If you don't follow 
that precept, the gc heap can become very fragmented.
Here is sample output from a very simple program.  Note that the "RefCount"
field only applies to RefCount Handles, and this field will contain the
reference count:

COMMAND: gchandleleaks.
!GCHandleLeaks
This command is an aid in tracking down GCHandle leaks. It searches all of 
memory for any references to the Strong and Pinned GCHandles in the process, 
and reports what it found. If a handle is found, you'll see the address of the
reference. This might be a stack address or a field within an object, for 
example. If a handle is not found in memory, you'll get notification of that 
The command has diagnostic output which doesn't need to be repeated here. One 
thing to keep in mind is that anytime you search all of memory for a value, you
can get false positives because even though the value was found, it might be 
garbage in that no code knows about the address. You can also get false 
negatives because a user is free to pass that GCHandle to unmanaged code that 
might store the handle in a strange way (shifting bits, for example).
For example, a GCHandle valuetype is stored on the stack with the low bit set 
if it points to a Pinned handle. So !GCHandleLeaks ignores the low bit in it's
searches.
That said, if a serious leak is going on, you'll get a ever-growing set of 
handle addresses that couldn't be found.
COMMAND: vmmap.

!VMMap traverses the virtual address space and lists the type of protection

!ProcInfo [-env] [-time] [-mem]
!ProcInfo lists the environment variables for the process, kernel CPU time, as 
well as memory usage statistics.
COMMAND: histinit.
!HistInit
Before running any of the Hist - family commands you need to initialize the SOS 
structures from the stress log saved in the debuggee.  This is achieved by the 
HistInit command.
Sample output:
0:001> !HistInit

COMMAND: histobj.
!HistObj <obj_address>
This command examines all stress log relocation records and displays the chain 
of GC relocations that may have led to the address passed in as an argument.
Conceptually the output is:
GenN    obj_address   root1, root2, root3,
GenN-1  prev_obj_addr root1, root2,
GenN-2  prev_prev_oa  root1, root4,

COMMAND: histclear.
!HistClear
This command releases any resources used by the Hist-family of commands. 
Generally there's no need to call this explicitly, as each HistInit will first 
cleanup the previous resources.
0:003> !HistClear
Completed successfully.
COMMAND: dumprcw.
!DumpRCW <RCW address>
This command lists information about a Runtime Callable Wrapper. You can use
!DumpObj to obtain the RCW address corresponding to a managed object.
The output contains all COM interface pointers that the RCW holds on to, which
is useful for investigating lifetime issues of interop-heavy applications.
COMMAND: dumpccw.
!DumpCCW <CCW address or COM IP>
This command lists information about a COM Callable Wrapper. You can use
!DumpObj to obtain the CCW address corresponding to a managed object or pass
a COM interface pointer to which the object has been marshaled.
The output contains the COM reference count of the CCW, which is useful for
investigating lifetime issues of interop-heavy applications.
