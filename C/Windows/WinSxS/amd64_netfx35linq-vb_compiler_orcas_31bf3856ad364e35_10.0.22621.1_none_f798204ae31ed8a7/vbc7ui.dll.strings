Using the iteration variable in a lambda expression may have unexpected results.  Instead, create a local variable within the loop and assign it the value of the iteration variable.
Lambda expression will not be removed from this event handler. Assign the lambda expression to a variable and use the variable to add and remove the event.
Using the iteration variable in a query expression may have unexpected results.  Instead, create a local variable within the loop and assign it the value of the iteration variable.
The 'AddressOf' expression has no effect in this context because the method argument to 'AddressOf' requires a relaxed conversion to the delegate type of the event. Assign the 'AddressOf' expression to a variable, and use the variable to add or remove the method as the handler.
