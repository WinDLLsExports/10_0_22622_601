5'{0}' is not a valid member of the '{1}' enumeration.
)Cannot find dismounted assignable device.
fThe operation could not be completed because no available locations were found on the disk controller.
The path '{0}' specifies a disk that is still in available storage and has not been moved into the virtual machine's cluster group. To move the disk, use the Failover Cluster Manager or the Move-ClusterResource cmdlet.
The configuration of virtual machine '{0}' was not refreshed within cluster '{1}' because the 'Failover Cluster Module for Windows PowerShell' feature is not enabled.  The virtual machine's configuration can be refreshed manually using the Update-ClusterVirtualMachineConfiguration cmdlet or Failover Cluster Manager.
MThe Update-ClusterVirtualMachineConfiguration command could not be completed.
HWindows could not verify that path '{0}' can be accessed by the cluster.
7Failed to get the virtual machine's cluster group name.
The cmdlet could not verify that the path '{0}' can be accessed by the cluster. If the cluster uses a non-Microsoft file system, or you are sure that the path can be accessed by the cluster, run the cmdlet again and use the -AllowUnverifiedPaths parameter to continue.
The path '{0}' specifies a disk that is in another cluster group. To move the disk into the virtual machine's cluster group, use the Failover Cluster Manager or the Move-ClusterResource cmdlet.
EThe path '{0}' is not a valid path that is accessible to the cluster.
The device naming setting only applies to synthetic network adapters on Generation 2 virtual machines with configuration version 6.2 or above.
-The file name at "{0}" is not in GUID format.
dSpecified port value "{0}" for "{1}" is not valid. Port value should be within the range 1 to 65535.
WThe node "{0}" specified in "{1}" should be a valid fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
The destination host is not configured for live migration. Use the Enable-VMMigration cmdlet to modify the Hyper-V settings on the destination host to enable migration.
Live migrations of virtual machines cannot be sent to the destination host because no migration networks are specified for incoming live migrations. To specify networks, run the Add-VMMigrationNetwork cmdlet on the destination host. To use any available network for live migration, run the command Set-VMHost -UseAnyNetworkForMigration $true on the destination host.
The Hyper-V module used in this Windows PowerShell session cannot be used for remote management of the server '{0}'. Load a compatible version of the Hyper-V module, or use Powershell remoting to connect directly to the remote server. For more information, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=532650.
Resource metering is not supported on virtual machine '{0}' because it is part of a VMCompatibilityReport. Complete the operation used to create the report, and then enable resource metering on the resulting virtual machine.
No changes were made to the host because no parameters were specified. To make changes to the host, run Set-VMHost with one or more parameters.
The source host is not configured for live migration. Use the Enable-VMMigration cmdlet to modify the Hyper-V settings on the source host to enable migration.
.The file name provided must be in GUID format.
,Hash table contains keys that are not valid.
Hash tables in the Vhds parameter must contain 'DestinationFilePath' key which points to the destination virtual hard drive file path.
|Hash tables in the Vhds parameter must contain 'SourceFilePath' key which points to the source virtual hard drive file path.
Hash table key is not a string.
The cluster object '{0}' is not a valid cluster group or virtual machine cluster resource. Run the command again and specify an object that represents a cluster group or virtual machine cluster resource.
