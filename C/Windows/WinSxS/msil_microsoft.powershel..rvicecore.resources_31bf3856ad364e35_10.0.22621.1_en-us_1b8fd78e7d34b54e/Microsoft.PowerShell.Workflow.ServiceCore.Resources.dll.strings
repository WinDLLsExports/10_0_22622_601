YThe activity failed because the connection to the remote computer '{0}' was disconnected.
The workflow cannot be started because the compiled activity for the workflow was not found. Cache the workflow definition by calling DefinitionCache.Instance.Add.
6Could not find an activity for the command name '{0}'.
Activity-Specific Parameters
The argument to -PSParameterCollection can not contain AsJob, JobName, InputObject or PSParameterCollection as entries. Remove the extra entries and try again.
RThe async result is already finished. A finished operation cannot be called twice.
?An End operation has already been called for this async result.
(The IAsyncResult specified is not valid.
Cannot remove the PSWorkflowJob without removing its parent. Please remove the ContainerParentJob that contains this PSWorkflowJob.
4Cannot supply both connection URI and computer name.
=The '{0}' cmdlet does not implement the InputObject property.
JCompilation error while building dependent workflows. For details see {0}.
Completed
Connectivity
The PSCredential parameter is supported only when the PSComputerName or PSConnectionUri parameters are used. The PSCredential parameter has been ignored.
rA credential cannot be specified when NegotiateWithImplicitCredential is specified as the value of Authentication.
IA CertificateThumbprint cannot be specified when Credential is specified.
8This activity does not support custom remote management.
Workflow variables cannot be modified inside the debugger.  The command or script did not run because it attempted to modify variable '${0}'.
7The debugger Quit command has stopped the workflow job.
The activity cannot continue running because an error occurred while importing dependent module(s) '{0}' specified for activity '{1}'.  To fix this problem, verify that the module exists on the computer. If the module is not required, remove references to the module from the activity.
BA duplicate instance ID was found. The instance ID already exists.
;An elapsed time-out occurred, and the workflow was stopped.
The workflow job cannot be suspended because it does not include checkpoints (also called persistence points). To make the workflow suspendable, use the PSPersist parameter of the workflow. To suspend the workflow forcibly, use the Force parameter of the Suspend-Job cmdlet.
3An error occurred while trying to run the activity.
8An exception has occurred while validating the workflow.
Workflow complete.
Failed
nThe force-suspend time-out period cannot be zero or null. Specify a time-out period that is greater than zero.
#Importing workflow from file '{0}'.
Input and Output
*The OwnerId of the instance is mismatched.
*The Version of the instance is mismatched.
The activity is not valid: {0}
5The async result from the file provider is not valid.
.The specified IAsyncResultObject is not valid.
JThe bookmark '{0}' is not valid; it does not exist in the workflow engine.
\The specified ActivityImplementationContext is not of type CimActivityImplementationContext.
6The label is not valid: The label '{0}' doesn't exist.
$The specified runspace is not valid.
The workflow definition has been recycled, because the workflow definition cache limit of {0} has been reached. Import the workflow or module again, and then retry the operation.
Workflow files must have a file name extension of .xaml or .dll, not {0}. If you are using a workflow with a file name extension of .dll, then you must pass only one assembly.
aThe job cannot be started. The job state must be NotStarted and the job can only be started once.
^The job could not be removed because a job matching the specified criteria could not be found.
2The job has been added to the queue to be resumed.
Stop operation is in progress.
7The debugger Quit command has stopped the workflow job.
!Suspend operation is in progress.
SA parameter element specified in the configuration does not have a Name attribute. 
The workflow job could not be created because the JobInvocationInfo does not contain a JobDefinition. Initialize the JobInvocationInfo with a JobDefinition to create a workflow job.
The workflow job could not be created because the JobInvocationInfo specifies a type other than WorkflowJobSourceAdapter. Correct the JobSourceAdapter type or verify that the correct type is being used.
4No workflows were found in the specified path '{0}'.
AA workflow instance does not exist for the specified Instance ID.
#Null or empty workflow is provided.
mThe '{0}' language mode  is not supported. Supported language modes are FullLanguage and ConstrainedLanguage.
"Internal Error: The object is marked for restricted construction, but another type is constructing it elsewhere.  
Target Type:{0}
Allowed Creator Type: {1}
Actual Creator Type: {2}
Method: {3}
"Only one computer name is allowed.
The argument to -PSParameterCollection can only contain one entry where PSComputerName is set to '*'. Remove the extra entries and try again.
BThe syntax of a parallel script block is 'Parallel { <commands> }'
Parameter {0} has been specified more than once. Remove multiple references to this parameter from the session configuration, and then try again.
The PSParameterCollection parameter can only be used with AsJob, JobName and InputObject. Move the additional parameters to within the PSParameterCollection argument and try again.
The value of the PersistencePath parameter {0} exceeds the maximum allowed length. The persistence path should not be greater than {1} characters.
eThe Persistence store has reached its maximum size. Free up storage space by removing completed jobs.
D"Cannot process the debugger command until the debugger is stopped."
 {0} line:{1} char:{2}
HValue {0} is out of the allowed range. Allowed range is from {1} to {2}.
*Removing workflow instance from the table.
"The workflow could not be resumed.
&Retrying activity action: attempt {0}.
1Retrying activity connection: attempt {0} of {1}.
Running
LThe activity has exceeded the specified maximum running time of {0} seconds.
GBecause a running time-out has occurred, the workflow has been stopped.
The input objects cannot be serialized. Serialized data is required to suspend and resume workflows. To resolve the error, verify that the values of all variables and parameters are of types that can be serialized.
The input objects cannot be serialized. This might prevent the workflow from being resumed correctly. The serialization error might indicate a problem with the data contract that is defined at the type or attribute level. To resolve the problem, verify that the values of all variables and parameters can be serialized. Serialization error is: {0}.
8Shutdown request is in progress, workflow is suspending.
Suspend could not be completed.
This PSWorkflowJob was recovered from another session in a suspended state. This can indicate that the workflow was interrupted by a process failure, or a system restart. Run Resume-Job to try resuming the workflow.
,The workflow '{0}' could not be started: {1}
8Unblock is not a supported operation on a PSWorkflowJob.
The workflow job could not be created because the JobInvocationInfo was not properly initialized. Initialize the JobInvocationInfo with workflow information.
Parameters defined for workflow functions do not support ValueFromPipeline. Remove this attribute and import or define the workflow again.
TA parameter element specified in the configuration does not have a Value attribute. 
1Workflows cannot call workflows on this platform.
This workflow job cannot be suspended because there are no checkpoints (also called persistence points) in the workflow. To make the workflow job suspendable, add checkpoints to the workflow.
For more information about how to add checkpoints, see the help topics for Windows PowerShell Workflow.
 This workflow is already loaded.
NOne or more workflows that are part of the specified job could not be removed.
The workflow job cannot be resumed, either because persistence data could not be saved completely, or saved persistence data has been corrupted.  You must restart the workflow.
0The workflow instance state file does not exist.
nThe workflow name "{0}" is not a valid workflow. Specify a valid workflow name and then try the command again.
OThe workflow is not running. The current state of the workflow instance is {0}.
(The workflow instance is not yet loaded.
!The provided XAML cannot be null.
Cannot load the workflow. Only signed in-box XAML-based workflows or script-based workflows are supported in the current language mode.
