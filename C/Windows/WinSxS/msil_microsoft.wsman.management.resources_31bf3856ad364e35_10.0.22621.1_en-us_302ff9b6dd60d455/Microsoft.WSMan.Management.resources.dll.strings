6CredSSP Authentication Configuration for WS-Management
CredSSP authentication allows the user credentials on this computer to be sent to a remote computer. If you use CredSSP authentication for a connection to a malicious or compromised computer, that computer will have access to your user name and password. For more information, see the Enable-WSManCredSSP Help topic.
Do you want to enable CredSSP authentication?
The {0} parameter cannot be used when the {1} parameter value is {2}. The {0} parameter can be used only when the {1} parameter value is {3}.
CredSSP authentication allows the server to accept user credentials from a remote computer.

WinRM Quick Configuration
Running the Set-WSManQuickConfig command has significant security implications, as it enables remote management through the WinRM service on this computer.
This command:
1. Checks whether the WinRM service is running. If the WinRM service is not running, the service is started.
2. Sets the WinRM service startup type to automatic.
3. Creates a listener to accept requests on any IP address. By default, the transport is HTTP.
4. Enables a firewall exception for WS-Management traffic.
5. Enables Kerberos and Negotiate service authentication.

This command modifies the RootSDDL setting for the WinRM service.  The RootSDDL stores the default security settings for any WinRM securable resource that does not specify its own SDDL. Changing the SDDL might affect security for many WinRM resources. Are you sure that you want to modify these default settings?
The configuration changes you made will only be effective after the WinRM service is restarted.  To restart the WinRM service, run the following command: 'Restart-Service winrm'
