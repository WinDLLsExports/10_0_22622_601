Synchronized status of a storage object and its Snapshots / Clones / Mirrors.
ObjectId is a mandatory property that is used to opaquely and uniquely identify an instance of a class. ObjectIds must be unique within the scope of the management server (which is hosting the provider). The ObjectId is created and maintained for use of the Storage Management Providers and their clients to track instances of objects. If an object is visible through two different paths (for example: there are two separate Storage Management Providers that point to the same storage subsystem) then the same object may appear with two different ObjectIds. For determining if two object instances are the same object, refer to the UniqueId property.
ObjectId
MSFT_StorageObject
UniqueId is a mandatory property that is used to uniquely identify a logical instance of a storage subsystem's object. This value must be the same for an object viewed by two or more provider instances (even if they are running on seperate management servers). UniqueId can be any globally unique, opaque value unless otherwise specified by a derived class.
UniqueId
PassThroughIds is a comma-separated list of all implementation specific keys. It is used by storage management applications to access the vendor proprietary object model. This field should be in the form: key1='value1',key2='value2'.

This property is a string representation of the partition's GPT GUID. This property is only valid if the disk's PartitionStyle property is set to 2 - 'GPT' and will be NULL for all other partition stlyes.
IsReadOnly
IsOffline
IsSystem
IsBoot
Signifies whether or not the partition is active and can be booted. This property is only relevant for MBR disks.
IsActive
If this property is set to TRUE, the partition is not detected by the mount manager. As a result, the partition does not receive a drive letter, does not receive a volume GUID path, does not host volume mount points, and is not enumerated by calls to FindFirstVolume and FindNextVolume. This ensures that applications such as disk defragmenter do not access the partition. The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) uses this attribute on its shadow copies.
IsHidden
If this property is set to TRUE, the partition is a shadow copy of another partition. This attribute is used by the Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS). This attribute is an indication for file system filter driver-based software (such as antivirus programs) to avoid attaching to the volume. An application can use this attribute to differentiate a shadow copy partition from a production partition. For example, an application that performs a fast recovery will break a shadow copy virtual disk by clearing the read-only and hidden attributes and this attribute. This attribute is set when the shadow copy is created and cleared when the shadow copy is broken.
IsShadowCopy
IsDAX
If this property is set to TRUE, the operating system does not assign a drive letter automatically when the partition is discovered. This is only honored for GPT disks and is assumed to be FALSE for MBR disks. This attribute is useful in storage area network (SAN) environments.

RequestStateChange changes the state of a job. The possible values are as follows: 
2 - 'Start' changes the state to 'Running'. 
3 - 'Suspend' stops the job temporarily. The intention is to subsequently restart the job with a second call to RequestStateChange requesting 1 - 'Start'. It might be possible to enter the 'Service' state while suspended. (This is job-specific.) 
4 - 'Terminate' stops the job cleanly, saving data, preserving the state, and shutting down all underlying processes in an orderly manner. 
5 - 'Kill' terminates the job immediately with no requirement to save data or preserve the state. 
6 - 'Service' puts the job into a vendor-specific service state. It might be possible to restart the job.

Maintenance2
This method resets the health and operational status of the physical disk. Exact behavior of this method is dependent on whether this physical disk belongs to a concrete pool. 
If it is a member of a concrete pool, the health and operational statuses should be reset to 1 - 'Healthy', and 1 - 'OK', respectively. If any additional errors are detected after Reset, the health and operational statuses should reflect these new errors. 
If the physical disk is not a member of a concrete pool, then this method should not only reset the health and operational statuses, but it should return the disk into a state where it is usable as storage for a concrete pool. For example: If a physical disk had become missing and then has reappeared (after it has been replaced) this physical disk is expected to be in the primordial pool only with an operational status indicating its data is either split or unrecognized. Calling Reset should clear the physical disk of any data, remove any remaining ties to its former concrete pool, and return the disk to a healthy, usable state.

This method creates a virtual disk using the resources of the storage pool. This method is available only when the SupportsVirtualDiskCreation property on the storage subsystem is set to TRUE. If it is set to FALSE, this method will fail with MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED. This method is also not supported for primordial pools. 
Creating tiered virtual disks is available only when the SupportsStorageTieredVirtualDiskCreation property on the storage subsystem is set to TRUE. If it is set to FALSE, this method will fail with MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED. 
CreateVirtualDisk requires only FriendlyName and Size to be specified. Sizes can be specified explicitly through the Size parameter, or you can use the maximum available space from the storage pool by specifying the UseMaximumSize parameter. Both FriendlyName and Size are treated as goals rather than hard requirements. For example, not all SMI-S based arrays support custom friendly names; however, the virtual disk creation will still succeed. If the size specified is not achieved, the actual size used for the virtual disk will be returned in the out parameter structure. 
The usage of this virtual disk can be set using the Usage and OtherUsageDescription parameters. If a value for OtherUsageDescription is given, Usage must be set to 1 - 'Other', otherwise an error will be returned. 
By default, the resiliency setting applied to this virtual disk will be whatever is specified in the storage pool's ResiliencySettingNameDefault property. This can be overridden using the ResiliencySettingName parameter. Note that the name given here must correspond to a resiliency setting associated with this storage pool. Any other value will result in an error. 
Individual settings of the resiliency setting can be overridden using the NumberOfDataCopies, PhysicalDiskRedundancy, NumberOfColumns, and Interleave parameters. If these parameters are not used, the defaults from the resiliency setting will be used. These overrides will not persist back to the particular resiliency setting instance; however some storage providers may choose to create a new resiliency setting instance to capture this new configuration. If any of the goals specified in the override parameters are out of range, or are not supported by the storage pool, an error will be returned. 
The provisioning policy for the virtual disk is determined in a similar way to the resiliency setting. If no preference is specified in the ProvisioningType parameter, the policy is determined by the storage pool's ProvisioningTypeDefault property. If the ProvisioningType parameter is specified, the default is ignored and the value specified will be used instead. 
Allocation can be further controlled by the PhysicalDisksToUse parameter. There may be certain scenarios where a storage administrator wants to manually choose which physical disks should back the virtual disk. When this parameter is specified, data for the virtual disk will only be stored on the physical disks in this array and not on any others.

This parameter allows the user to specify the FriendlyName at the time of the virtual disk creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not required to be unique. Note that some storage subsystems do not allow setting a friendly name during virtual disk creation. If a subsystem doesn't support this, virtual disk creation should still succeed, however the disk may have a different name assigned to it.
Indicates the size for the virtual disk. Note that some storage subsystems will round the size up or down to a multiple of its allocation unit size. This parameter cannot be used if UseMaximumSize is set to TRUE.

Specifies the number of underlying physical disks across which data should be striped. If specified, this value will override the NumberOfColumnsDefault value that would have been inherited from the resiliency setting specified by ResiliencySettingName.
If TRUE, this field instructs the storage provider (or subsystem) to automatically pick what it determines to be the best number of columns for the virtual disk. If this field is TRUE, then the NumberOfColumns parameter must be NULL.
AutoNumberOfColumns
Specifies the number of bytes that should be used for a strip in the common striping-based resiliency settings. The strip is defined as the size of the portion of a stripe that lies on one physical disk. Thus Interleave * NumberOfColumns will yield the size of one stripe of user data. If this parameter is specified, this value will override the InterleaveDefault which would have been inherited from the resiliency setting specified by ResiliencySettingName.
Determines the allocation behavior for this virtual disk. Enclosure aware virtual disks will intelligently pick the physical disks to use for their redundancy. If TRUE, the virtual disk will attempt to use physical disks from different enclosures to balance the fault tolerance between two (or more) physical enclosures.
If specified, allocation of this virtual disk's storage is limited to the physical disks in the list. These physical disks must already be added to this storage pool.

One or more physical disks are not connected to the nodes on which the pool is being created.
This parameter allows the user to specify the FriendlyName at the time of the storage pool creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not required to be unique. Note that some storage subsystems do not allow setting a friendly name during pool creation. If a subsystem doesn't support this, storage pool creation should still succeed, however the pool may have a different name assigned to it.
Allows a user to set a custom usage type for the new storage pool object. This parameter can only be specified if the Usage parameter is set to 1 - 'Other'. 
This parameter is used to specify an array of physical disk objects that will be used as the backing data storage for the created storage pool. The physical disks must come from a primordial pool on the subsystem on which you are creating this pool. Only the disks from a single primordial pool may be used.
This parameter indicates the resiliency setting to be used by default when creating a new virtual disk on this storage pool. If the subsystem's SupportsMultipleResiliencySettingsPerStoragePool property is set to FALSE, this parameter also acts as a hint to the Storage Management Provider on which resiliency setting should be inherited by this storage pool. If no value is given, it is up to the Storage Management Provider to pick the most appropriate resiliency setting.

CreateStoragePool2
This method allows for the creation of virtual disks on a storage subsystem. This method is typically used when either a) the subsystem's storage pools do not allow virtual disk creation directly, or b) the subsystem does not support storage pools. Storage Management Providers may also choose to implement this method to 'intelligently' pick a storage pool for the user. If this method is supported, the subsystem's SupportsAutomaticStoragePoolSelection property should be set to TRUE.
47000
No storage pools were found that can support this virtual disk configuration.
This parameter allows the user to specify the desired FriendlyName at the time of the virtual disk creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not required to be unique. Note that some storage subsystems do not allow setting a friendly name during virtual disk creation. If a subsystem doesn't support this, virtual disk creation should still succeed, however the disk may have a different name assigned to it.
Allows a user to set a custom usage type for the new virtual disk object. This parameter can only be specified if the Usage parameter is set to 1 - 'Other'. 
Indicates the desired size for the virtual disk. Note that some storage subsystems will round the size up or down to a multiple of its allocation unit size. If this parameter is specified, UseMaximumSize must be NULL or FALSE.
Create a virtual disk using the largest supported size. This parameter cannot be used with the Size parameter.
Specifies the number of complete data copies to maintain for this virtual disk.
Specifies how many physical disk failures the virtual disk should be able to withstand before data loss occurs.
Specifies the number of underlying physical disks across which data should be striped.
Specifies the number of bytes used to form a strip in common striping-based resiliency settings. The strip is defined as the size of the portion of a stripe that lies on one physical disk. Thus Interleave * NumberOfColumns will yield the total size of one stripe.
This field specifies whether a parity-based resiliency setting is using a rotated or non-rotated parity layout. If the resiliency setting is not parity based, this field must be set to NULL
Denotes the provisioning type of the virtual disk. A value of 1 - 'Thin' means that the storage for the disk is allocated on-demand. A value of 2 - 'Fixed' means that the storage is allocated up front.
Creates logical grouping of virtual disks, target ports, and initiators for the purpose of showing virtual disks to host systems.
This parameter allows the user to specify the desired FriendlyName for the masking set at the time of its creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not requried to be unique.
This parameter specifies the list of virtual disks to show to the initiators in the masking set. The identifier used by this parameter is the virtual disk Name property. This parameter has a 1:1 mapping with the DeviceAccesses parameter (the arrays must be the same length and have the same order).
This parameter specifies the level of access the initiator should have to each virtual disk specified by VirtualDiskNames. This parameter has a 1:1 mapping with the VirtualDiskNames parameter (the arrays must be the same length and have the same order).
Specifies the order in which the virtual disks should be exposed to the initiator. This capability is only available if the storage subsystem's MaskingClientSelectableDeviceNumbers property is set to TRUE. If specified, this parameter must have a 1:1 mapping with the VirtualDiskNames parameter.
This parameter specifies the target ports which should be used when showing the virtual disks to the initiators. The number of target ports that can be specified depends on the subsystem's MaskingPortsPerView property. If MaskingPortsPerView is set to 4 - 'All target ports share the same view', this parameter is essentially ignored as all target ports on the system will be associated with this masking set.
This parameter specifies the initiators for which the virtual disks should be shown. If the subsystem's MaskingOneInitiatorIdPerView property is TRUE, only one initiator can be specified for this masking set. The list of valid initiator address formats can be determined through the subsystem's MaskingValidInitiatorIdTypes property.
