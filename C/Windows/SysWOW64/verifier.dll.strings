Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.+Critical section debug information address.WCritical section initialization stack trace. Run dps <address> to dump the stack trace.
This stop is generated if a thread (thread ID is parameter1) is terminated,
suspended or is in a state (worker thread finished a work item) in which it
cannot hold a critical section. The current thread is the culprit.
To debug this stop use the following debugger commands:
$ kb - to get the current stack trace. If the current thread is the owner of
the critical section it is probably calling ExitThread.
The current thread should have released the critical section before exiting.
If the current thread is calling TerminateThread or SuspendThread then it
should not do this for a thread holding a critical section.
$ !cs -s parameter2 - dump information about this critical section.
$ ln parameter2 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This should help identify the leaked critical section.
$ dps parameter4 - to dump the stack trace for this critical section initialization.
4Unloading DLL containing an active critical section.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.WCritical section initialization stack trace. Run dps <address> to dump the stack trace.
DLL name address.
DLL base address.
This stop is generated if a DLL has a global variable containing a critical section
and the DLL is unloaded but the critical section has not been deleted. To debug
this stop use the following debugger commands:
$ du parameter3 - to dump the name of the culprit DLL.
$ .reload dllname or .reload dllname = parameter4 - to reload the symbols for that DLL.
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This should help identify the leaked critical section.
$ dps parameter2 - to dump the stack trace for this critical section initialization.
9Freeing heap block containing an active critical section.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.WCritical section initialization stack trace. Run dps <address> to dump the stack trace.
Heap block address.
Heap block size.
This stop is generated if a heap allocation contains a critical section,
the allocation is freed and the critical section has not been deleted.
To debug this stop use the following debugger commands:
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This should help identify the leaked critical section.
$ dps parameter2 - to dump the stack trace for this critical section initialization.
$ parameter3 and parameter4 might help understand where this heap block was
allocated (the size of the allocation is probably significant).

Run dps <address> to dump the stack trace.MSecond initialization stack trace. Run dps <address> to dump the stack trace.
Usually this stop is generated if a critical section has been initialized more
than one time. In this case parameter3 and parameter4 are the stack trace
addresses for two of these initializations. Some other times it is possible
to get this stop if the critical section or its debug information structure
has been corrupted. In this second case it is possible that parameter3 and
parameter4 are invalid and useless. To debug this stop:
$ !cs -s -d parameter2 - dump information about this critical section.
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This might help identify the critical section if this is a global variable.
$ dps parameter3 and dps parameter4 - to identify the two code paths for
initializing this critical section.
2Free memory containing an active critical section.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.+Critical section debug information address.WCritical section initialization stack trace. Run dps <address> to dump the stack trace.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the memory containing a critical section was freed
but the critical section has not been deleted using DeleteCriticalSection.
To debug this stop use the following debugger commands:
$ !cs -s -d parameter2 - dump information about this critical section.
$ dps parameter3 - to identify the code path for initializing this critical section.
In most cases the lock verifier detects immediately leaked critical sections
contained in a heap allocation, a DLL range, a virtual memory allocation
or a MapViewOfFile mapped memory range and issues different stops in these cases.
So there are very few cases left for this verifier stop. The lock must be
in a memory range freed by kernel-mode code or freed cross-process by APIs
like VirtualFreeEx. Most typically this stop will  be encountered if a previous stop
(e.g. LOCK_IN_FREED_HEAP or LOCK_IN_UNLOADED_DLL) was continued by
hitting `g' in the debugger console.
Corrupted critical section.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.;Invalid debug information address of this critical section.:Address of the debug information found in the active list.FInitialization stack trace. Run dps <address> to dump the stack trace.
This stop is generated if the DebugInfo field of the critical section is
pointing freed memory. Usually another valid DebugInfo structure is
found in the active critical section list. Without corruption the two
pointers should be identical. To debug this stop use the following debugger commands:
$ !cs -s -d parameter3 - dump information about this critical section
based on the current contents of the debug info structure
found in the active list (this structure is rarely corrupted so usually
this information is trustworthy).
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section based
on the current contents of the critical section structure (the structure
is corrupted already so sometimes this information is NOT trustworthy).
$ dps parameter4 - to identify the code path for initializing this critical section.
Dump the critical section at address parameter1 and look for the corruption
pattern. With good symbols for ntdll.dl you can use the following commands:
$ dt ntdll!_RTL_CRITICAL_SECTION LOCK_ADDRESS
$ dt ntdll!_RTL_CRITICAL_SECTION_DEBUG DEBUG_ADDRESS
&Invalid critical section owner thread.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.
Owning thread.
Expected owning thread.$Critical section debug info address.
This stop is generated if the owner thread ID is invalid in the current
context. For example, the critical section is being released by a thread 
other than the one that acquired it. To debug this stop:
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This should help identify the critical section.
)Invalid critical section recursion count.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.
Recursion count.
Expected recursion count.$Critical section debug info address.
This stop is generated if the recursion count field of the critical section
structure is invalid in the current context. To debug this stop:
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This should help identify the critical section.
2Deleting critical section with invalid lock count.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.

Expected lock count.
Owning thread.
This stop is generated if a critical section is owned by a thread if it is deleted
or if the critical section is uninitialized. To debug this stop:
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.
If the owning thread is 0 the critical section has not been initialized.
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This should help identify the critical section.
,Critical section over-released or corrupted.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.
Lock count.
Expected lock count.$Critical section debug info address.
This stop is generated if a critical section is released more times than the
current thread acquired it. To debug this stop:
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.
$ !cs -s -d parameter4 - dump information about this critical section.
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This should help identify the critical section.
!Critical section not initialized.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.$Critical section debug info address.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if a critical section is used without being
initialized or after it has been deleted. To debug this stop:
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This should help identify the critical section.
(Critical section is already initialized.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.$Critical section debug info address.AFirst initialization stack trace. Use dps to dump it if non-NULL.
Not used.
This stop is generated if a critical section is reinitialized by the
current thread. To debug this stop:
$ !cs -s parameter1 or !cs -s -d parameter2 - dump information about this critical section.
$ ln parameter1 - to show symbols near the address of the critical section.
This might help identify the critical section if this is a global variable.
$ dps parameter3 - to identify the code path for the first initialization of this
critical section.
$ kb - to display the current stack trace, that is reinitializing this critical section.

Memory block address.
Memory block size.
This stop is generated if the current thread is calling VirtualFree on a
memory block that contains an active critical section. The application should call
DeleteCriticalSection on this critical section before if frees this memory.
$ kb - to display the current stack trace, that is calling VirtualFree.
The probable culprit is the DLL that calls VirtualFree.
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.
$ dps parameter2 - to identify the code path for the initialization

Memory block size.
This stop is generated if the current thread is calling UnmapViewOfFile
on a memory block that contains an active critical section. The application
should call DeleteCriticalSection on this critical section before if unmaps this memory.
$ kb - to display the current stack trace, that is calling UnmapViewOfFile .
The probable culprit is the DLL that calls UnmapViewOfFile.
$ !cs -s parameter1 - dump information about this critical section.
$ dps parameter2 - to identify the code path for the initialization of
this critical section.
2Current thread does not own any critical sections.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.4Number of critical sections owned by current thread.
Not used
Not used
This stop is generated if the current thread is calling LeaveCriticalSection but,
according to the internal verifier bookkeeping, it doesn't own any critical section.
If parameter2 is zero, probably this is a bug in the current thread.
It either tries to leave a critical section that it didn't enter, or maybe
it is calling LeaveCriticalSection more times than it called EnterCriticalSection
for the same critical section.
If parameter2 is not zero (it is a negative integer number) the internal
verifier data structures are probably corrupted.
6Using critical section that is private to another DLL.GCritical section address. Run !cs -s <address> to get more information.
Not used.
Not used
Not used
This stop is generated if the current thread tries to use a private lock that lives
inside another DLL. For example a.dll tries to enter a critical section
defined inside ntdll.dll. Private locks cannot be used across DLLs.

Not used
This stop is generated if the SRW lock (Param1) is being re-initialized.
If the SRW lock is being actively used by other threads, re-initializing the
lock will result in unpredictable behavior by the application (may stop responding
or crash). The initialization stack trace may show an acquire if the SRW lock
was statically initialized.
$ kb - to get the current stack trace. This is where the SRW lock is being
re-initialized. 
$ dps Param3 - to get the SRW lock initialization stack trace. This stack trace 
may show an acquire if the lock was statically initialized.
+Mismatched Acquire-Release on the SRW lock.

Not used
This stop is generated if the SRW lock (Param1) is being released with
a wrong release API.
If the SRW lock was acquired for shared access and is being released using the
exclusive release API or the SRW lock was acquired for exclusive access and is
being release using the shared release API.
This can result in unpredictable behavior by the application such as crashing or
not responding to input.
$ kb - to get the current stack trace. This is where the SRW lock is being

$ dps Param3 - to get the SRW lock acquire stack trace.
>The SRW lock is being acquired recursively by the same thread.
SRW LockcAddress of the first acquire stack trace. Use dps <address> to see where the SRW lock was acquired.
Not used
Not used
This stop is generated if the SRW lock (Param1) is being acquired
recursively by the same thread.
This will result in a deadlock and the thread would block indefinitely.
Recursive acquisition of an SRW lock in exclusive mode will cause a deadlock.
Recursive acquisition of an SRW lock in shared mode will cause a deadlock when
there is a thread waiting for exclusive access. Consider the example below:
- Thread A acquires the SRW lock in shared mode
- Thread B tries to acquire the SRW lock in exclusive mode and waits
- Thread A tries to acquire the SRW lock in shared mode recursively. This will
  be successful as long as there is no exclusive waiter (in this case B). Since
  SRW locks do not have writer starvation, thread A waits behind thread B.
  Now, Thread B is waiting for Thread A which is inturn waiting for Thread B
  causing a circular wait and hence a deadlock.
$ kb - to get the current stack trace. This is where the SRW lock is being
acquired recursively. 
$ dps Param2 - to get the stack trace for the first acquire.
@The thread that is exiting or being terminated owns an SRW lock.

Not used
This stop is generated if the thread (Param2) that owns the SRW lock (Param1)
is exiting or being terminated.
This will result in an orphaned SRW lock and the threads trying to acquire this
lock would block indefinitely.
$ kb - to get the current stack trace. This is where the thread is exiting or

This stop is generated if the SRW lock (Param1) is being released by the
thread (Param2) that didn't acquire the lock.
This represents bad programming practice that is hard to get right and can lead 
to unpredictable behavior by the application.

This stop is generated if the memory address (Param1) being freed contains 
an active SRW lock that is still in use.
This can result in unpredictable behavior by the application such as crashing or
not responding to input.

This stop is generated if the DLL being unloaded (Param2) contains 
an active SRW lock (Param1) that is still in use.
This can result in unpredictable behavior by the application such as crashing or
not responding to input.
$ kb - to get the current stack trace. This is where the DLL is being unloaded

1Invalid handle exception for current stack trace.
Exception code.)Exception record. Use .exr to display it.'Context record. Use .cxr to display it.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the function on the top of the stack passed an
invalid handle to system routines. Usually a simple kb command will reveal
what is the value of the handle passed (must be one of the parameters -
usually the first one). If the value is null then this is clearly wrong.
If the value looks ok you need to use !htrace debugger extension to get a
history of operations pertaining to this handle value. In most cases it
must be that the handle value is used after being closed.
/Invalid TLS index used for current stack trace.
Invalid TLS index.!Expected lower part of the index.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the function on the top of the stack passed an invalid TLS
index to TLS system routines. Usually a simple kb command will reveal what is wrong.
The typical bug here is to assume a certain value for a TLS index instead of
calling TlsAlloc. This can happen either by thinking that you always get
value N therefore there is no need to call TlsAlloc or more frequently
due to an uninitialized variable.
3Invalid parameters for WaitForMultipleObjects call.!Address of object handles vector.
Number of handles.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the function on the top of the stack called
WaitForMultipleObjects with NULL as the address of the array of handles
to wait for or with zero as the number of handles. A simple kb command
will reveal the function calling this API incorrectly.
=NULL handle passed as parameter. A valid handle must be used.

&Waiting on a thread handle in DllMain.
Thread handle.
Not used.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the current thread is currently running code inside
the DllMain function of one of the DLLs loaded in the current process and
it calls WaitForSingleObject or WaitForMultipleObjects to wait on a thread handle
in the same process. This would most likely lead to a deadlock because the thread
handle will not get signaled unless that second thread is exiting. When the second
thread will call ExitThread it will try to acquire the DLL loader lock then call
DllMain (DLL_THREAD_DETACH) for all DLLs in the current process. But the loader lock
is owned by the first thread (the one that is waiting on the thread handle) so the
two threads will deadlock.
!Incorrect object type for handle.
Handle value.&Object type name. Use du to display it/Expected object type name. Use du to display it
Not used.
This stop is generated if the current thread is calling an API with a handle to
an object with an incorrect object type. E.g. calling SetEvent with a semaphore
handle as parameter will generate this stop. To debug this stop:
$ kb - to display the current stack trace. The culprit is probably the DLL
that is calling into verifier.dll;
$ du parameter2 - to display the actual type of the handle. The handle value
is parameter1. In the example above, this will display: Semaphore.
$ du parameter3 - to display the object type expected by the API. In the example above,
this name will be: Event.
$ !htrace parameter1 might be helpful because it will display the stack
trace for the recent open/close operations on this handle.
:Unloading DLL that allocated TLS index that was not freed.
TLS index2Address of the code that allocated this TLS index.$DLL name address. Use du to dump it.
DLL base address.
This stop is generated if a DLL that allocated a TLS index is being unloaded
before freeing that TLS index. To debug this stop:
$ du parameter3 - display the name of the culprit DLL;
$ .reload xxx.dll=parameter4 - reload symbols for the culprit DLL (if needed).
xxx.dll is the name of the DLL displayed in the above step;
$ u parameter2 - disassemble the code that allocated the TLS. This should
point to the function that allocated the TLS but forgot to free it
before the DLL was unloaded.
!Corrupted verifier TLS structure.
TEB address.
Expected TEB address.
Thread ID.
Expected thread ID.
This stop is generated if the internal verifier structures used to
store the state of TLS slots for thread are corrupted. Very likely this is
due to some random corruption in the process.
Using an invalid TLS index.
TLS index
Not Used.
Not Used.
Not Used.
This stop is generated if an invalid TLS index is used. In most cases, it's because
code is still using this index when TlsFree is called.
Here is an example for the threadpool thread.
T1: Dll loads and TlsAlloc
T1: Queue callback
T1: Skipped waited/cancelled callback
T1: TlsFree
T2: Callback runs and calls TlsSetValue
T1: Dll unloads
@Freeing virtual memory block with invalid size or start address.
Allocation base address.
Memory region size.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualFree or a DLL unload
with an invalid start address or size of the memory allocation.
In the case of DLL unload this probably means a memory corruption inside the loaded DLL list.
To debug this stop look at the current stack trace and the memory address and size
that is about to be freed and try to determine why they are invalid.
Incorrect virtual alloc call.#Pointer to allocation base address.
Pointer to memory region size.

Not used
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualAlloc call with an invalid
start address or size of the memory allocation. To debug this stop look at the current
stack trace (kb) and the memory address and size that is about to be allocated and try
to determine why they are invalid.
Incorrect map view call. Pointer to mapping base address.
Pointer to view size.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a MapViewOfFile call
with an invalid base address or size of the mapping. To debug this stop
look at the current stack trace (kb) and the memory address and size that
is about to be mapped and try to determine why they are invalid.
Probing invalid address.
Start address.
Memory block size.
Invalid address.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects an IsBadXXXPtr call with an
invalid address (e.g. a kernel-mode address, instead of a normal user-mode address)
for the memory buffer to be probed. To debug this stop look at the current stack
trace (kb) and try to determine why the caller of the IsBadXXXPtr function ended
up with an invalid address. Many times, the address is plain bogus, e.g.
an uninitialized pointer.
MSDN library lists a few reasons why applications should not use the IsBadXXXPtr APIs:
In a preemptive multitasking environment, it is possible for some other thread to change
the process's access to the memory being tested.
Dereferencing potentially invalid pointers can disable stack expansion in other threads.
A thread exhausting its stack, when stack expansion has been disabled, results in
the immediate termination of the parent process, with no pop-up error window or
diagnostic information.
Threads in a process are expected to cooperate in such a way that one will not free
memory that the other needs. Use of this function does not negate the need to do this.
If this is not done, the application may fail in an unpredictable manner.
Because of all these reasons, we recommend to never use these APIs.
Probing free memory.
Start address.
Memory block size.
Address of free memory page.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects an IsBadXXXPtr call for a
memory allocation that is free. This is very bad because it is possible that,
in some other cases, this memory was already reused for some other allocation.
Since the current code path (kb) doesn't own that memory, it could end up
corrupting someone else's memory, with disastrous effects.
To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and try to determine
why the caller of the IsBadXXXPtr function ended up probing free memory.
The address could be plain bogus (e.g. uninitialized pointer) or maybe
already freed memory. If the memory was already freed by one of the
VirtualFree or UnmapViewOfFile APIs, `!avrf -vs -a parameter3' will search
for a log of stack traces of the code paths that allocated/freed that address
and display these stack traces if they are available. This might show the stack
trace that freed up this memory. More often, the memory is an already freed
heap allocation. To check for that possibility, `!avrf -hp -a parameter3' will
search for a log of stack traces of the code paths that allocated/freed that
address from/to the heap and display these stack traces if they are available.
MSDN library lists a few reasons why applications should not use the IsBadXXXPtr APIs:
In a preemptive multitasking environment, it is possible for some other thread
to change the process's access to the memory being tested.
Dereferencing potentially invalid pointers can disable stack expansion in

Probing a guard page.
Start address.
Memory block size.
Address of guard page.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects an IsBadXXXPtr call for a
memory allocation that contains at least one GUARD_PAGE. This is very bad
because it is very possible that this GUARD_PAGE is the end of the current
stack of a thread. As documented in the MSDN library: Dereferencing potentially
invalid pointers can disable stack expansion in other threads. A thread exhausting
its stack, when stack expansion has been disabled, results in the immediate
termination of the parent process, with no pop-up error window or diagnostic
information. To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and try
to determine why the caller of the IsBadXXXPtr function ended up probing a GUARD_PAGE.

to change the process's access to the memory being tested.
Dereferencing potentially invalid pointers can disable stack expansion in
other threads. A thread exhausting its stack, when stack expansion has been
disabled, results in the immediate termination of the parent process,
with no pop-up error window or diagnostic information.
Threads in a process are expected to cooperate in such a way that one
will not free memory that the other needs. Use of this function does
not negate the need to do this. If this is not done, the application
may fail in an unpredictable manner.
Because of all these reasons, we recommend to never use these APIs.
Probing NULL address.
Not used.
Not used.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects an IsBadXXXPtr call with a
NULL address. To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and
try to determine why the caller of the IsBadXXXPtr function ended up with
the NULL address. This is typically the sign of someone not checking the
return value of one of the memory allocation functions. For example the code
below is incorrect:
int main (void)
PVOID p;
p = malloc (1024);
Use (p);
return 0;
void Use (PVOID p)
if (IsBadReadPtr (p)) {
return;
// p is safe to be used here.
This code should be re-written as this:
int main (void)
PVOID p;
p = malloc (1024);
if (NULL == p)) {
return -1;
Use (p);
return 0;
void Use (PVOID p)
// p is safe to be used here.

8Probing memory block with invalid start address or size.
Start address.
Memory block size.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects an IsBadXXXPtr call with an
invalid start address (e.g. a kernel-mode address, instead of a normal user-mode
address) or invalid size for the memory buffer to be probed. To debug this stop
look at the current stack trace (kb) and try to determine why the caller of
the IsBadXXXPtr function ended up with an invalid address or size.
Many times, the address or size are plain bogus, e.g. an uninitialized variables.

1Unloading DLL with invalid size or start address.
DLL memory base address.
DLL memory range size.$DLL name address. Use du to dump it.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a DLL unload with an invalid
start address or size of the DLL memory range. This probably means a memory
corruption inside the internal ntdll.dll loaded DLL list.
AFreeing memory block inside current thread's stack address range.
Allocation base address.
Memory region size.
Stack low limit address.
Stack high limit address.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualFree for a block of
memory that is actually part of the current thread's stack (!).
To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and try to understand
why the function that called VirtualFree thought that the memory block was
dynamically allocated or mapped but that was actually memory allocated from the stack.
7Incorrect FreeType parameter for VirtualFree operation.(Incorrect value used by the application.
Expected correct value 1.
Expected correct value 2.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualFree with an
incorrect value for the FreeType parameter. The only two acceptable values for
this parameter are MEM_DECOMMIT and MEM_RELEASE. If VirtualFree is called
with any other value except these two, VirtualFree will fail to free the memory.
To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb): the caller of VirtualFree
is probably the culprit.
9Trying to free virtual memory block that is already free.
Memory block address.
Not used.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualFree for an address
that is already free. To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb)
and try to determine why the memory is already free but the application is
trying to free it again. `!avrf -vs -a parameter1' will search for a log of
stack traces of the code paths that allocated/freed that address and display
these stack traces if they are available. This might show the stack trace that
freed up this memory.
AIncorrect Size parameter for VirtualFree (MEM_RELEASE) operation.'Incorrect size used by the application.
Expected correct size (0).
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualFree (MEM_RELEASE)
with a non-zero value for the dwSize parameter. When using MEM_RELEASE ,
the only acceptable value for this parameter is 0. If VirtualFree is called
with any other value except 0, VirtualFree will fail to free the memory.
To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb): the caller of
VirtualFree is probably the culprit.
7Unexpected exception raised in DLL entry point routine.
DLL name (use du to dump it).)Exception record. Use .exr to display it.'Context record. Use .cxr to display it.
Verifier dll descriptor
This stop is generated if a DLL's entry point (DllMain) function is raising
an exception. One example why this is bad is: if DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) is
raising an exception, the Windows DLL loader will:
- Catch and hide the exception;
- Unload the DLL without calling its DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_DETACH).
So in many cases the DLL allocated some resources already, then it raised the
exception, and it will not have a chance to release these resources on
DllMain (DLL_PROCESS_DETACH).
To debug this stop:
$ du parameter1 - to display the DLL name;
$ .exr parameter2 - to display the exception information;
$ .cxr parameter3 followed by kb - to display the exception context information
and the stack trace for the time when the exception was raised;
$ parameter4 is the address of an internal verifier structure and doesn't
have any significance for most of the verifier users.
/Unexpected exception raised in thread function.
Exception code.)Exception record. Use .exr to display it.'Context record. Use .cxr to display it.
Not used.
This stop is generated if a thread function is raising an exception. This
is bad because the whole process will be killed.
To debug this stop:
$ parameter1 might be significant for the type of exception. E.g. an
exception code C0000005 means Access Violation;
$ .exr parameter2 - to display the exception information;
$ .cxr parameter3 followed by kb - to display the exception context information;
1Unexpected exception raised while probing memory.
Exception code.
)Exception record. Use .exr to display it.'Context record. Use .cxr to display it.
Not used
This stop is generated if we get an exception during an IsBadXXXPtr call. This means
that the memory buffer we are probing doesn't actually have the protection
assumed by the caller, or that the memory was freed already, etc. See the
discussion above about other stop code (PROBE_INVALID_ADDRESS,
PROBE_FREE_MEM, PROBE_GUARD_PAGE, PROBE_NULL, PROBE_INVALID_START_OR_SIZE) for
more examples of why using the IsBadXXXPtr APIs is not recommended.
To debug this stop:
$ parameter1 will typically be C0000005 and that means Access Violation;
$ .exr parameter2 - to display the exception information;
$ .cxr parameter3 followed by kb - to display the exception context information
and stack trace at the time when the exception was raised;
Trying to reset NULL address.
Not used.
Not used.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a VirtualFree (MEM_RESET) call
with a NULL first parameter.  MEM_RESET should be used only for already
allocated memory, so NULL is not a valid first parameter in this case.
FFreeing heap memory block inside current thread's stack address range.
Allocation base address.
Memory region size.
Stack low limit address.
Stack high limit address.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects a HeapFree, for a block of
memory that is actually part of the current thread's stack (!).
To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and try to understand
why the function that called HeapFree thought that the memory block was dynamically
allocated or mapped but that was actually memory allocated from the stack.
DUnmapping memory region inside current thread's stack address range.
Allocation base address.
Memory region size.
Stack low limit address.
Stack high limit address.
This stop is generated if the app verifier detects an UnmapViewOfFile, for a block of
memory that is actually part of the current thread's stack (!).
To debug this stop look at the current stack trace (kb) and try to understand
why the function that called UnmapViewOfFile thought that the memory block was dynamically
allocated or mapped but that was actually memory allocated from the stack.
Incorrect RTL_RESOURCE address.
Address.
Not used.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the application is trying to use NULL or some other
incorrect address (e.g. a kernel-mode address) as the address of a valid
object. RtlInitializeResource (NULL) is an incorrect API call that will trigger
this kind of verifier stop.
param1 is the incorrect address used and the culprit is on the stack
trace (display it with kb).
!Invalid critical section address.
Address.
Not used.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the application is trying to use NULL or some other
incorrect address (e.g. a kernel-mode address) as the address of a valid
object. EnterCriticalSection(NULL) is an incorrect API call that will trigger
this kind of verifier stop.
param1 is the incorrect address used and the culprit is on the stack
trace (display it with kb).
1Attempt to execute code in non-executable memory.
Address being accessed.
Code performing invalid access.)Exception record. Use .exr to display it.'Context record. Use .cxr to display it.
This stop is generated if the application is trying to run code from
an address that is non-executable or free.
To debug this stop:
$ u parameter2 - to unassemble the culprit code
$ .exr parameter3 - to display the exception information;
$ .cxr parameter4 followed by kb - to display the exception context information
and the stack trace for the time when the exception was raised.
=Unexpected exception raised while initializing output buffer.
Buffer start address.
Buffer size.)Exception record. Use .exr to display it.'Context record. Use .cxr to display it.
This stop is generated if we get an exception while initializing a buffer specified
as output parameter for a Win32 or CRT API. This typically means that the specified
output buffer size is incorrect.
To debug this stop:
$ .exr parameter3 - to display the exception information;
$ .cxr parameter4 followed by kb - to display the exception context information
and stack trace at the time when the exception was raised.
9Unexpected exception when trying to find heap block size.&Address of the heap block being freed.
Heap handle.)Exception record. Use .exr to display it.'Context record. Use .cxr to display it.
This stop is generated if we get an exception while calling HeapSize for a heap block
that is being freed. This typically means that the specified heap block address is
incorrect or the heap is corrupted.
To debug this stop:
$ .exr parameter3 - to display the exception record;
$ .cxr parameter4 followed by kb - to display the exception context information
and stack trace at the time when the exception was raised.
0Freeing memory block with invalid start address.$Address of memory block being freed.&Expected correct memory block address.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the program calls VirtualFree (MEM_RELEASE)
with an lpAddress parameter that is not the base address returned by
the VirtualAlloc or VirtualAllocEx function when the region of pages
was reserved;
To debug this stop:
$ kb - to display the current stack trace, that is calling VirtualFree.
The probable culprit is the DLL that calls VirtualFree.
2Unmapping memory block with invalid start address.'Address of memory block being unmapped.&Expected correct memory block address.
Not used.
Not used.
This stop is generated if the program calls UnmapViewOfFile with
an lpBaseAddress parameter that is not identical to the value returned
by a previous call to the MapViewOfFile or MapViewOfFileEx function.
To debug this stop:
$ kb - to display the current stack trace, that is calling UnmapViewOfFile.
The probable culprit is the DLL that calls UnmapViewOfFile.
<unexpected exception raised in threadpool callback function.
Exception code(Exception record. Use .exr to display it&Context record. Use .cxr to display it
Not used
This stop is generated if a callback function in the threadpool thread is raising an exception.
To debug this stop:
$ parameter1 might be significant for the type of exception. E.g. an
exception code C0000005 means Access Violation.
$ .exr parameter2 - to display the exception information.
$ .cxr parameter3 followed by kb - to display the exception context information.
