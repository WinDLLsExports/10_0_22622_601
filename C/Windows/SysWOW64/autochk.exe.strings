Autochk cannot lock system volume due to a sharing violation.
This is caused by a driver holding a file opened for write access.
Check all newly added driver NtCreateFile and NtOpenFile calls or run:
       !FindAutochkBlockers
From "kd" to list the files which may be preventing autochk from running.

CHKDSK [volume[[path]filename]]] [/F] [/V] [/R] [/X] [/I] [/C] [/L[:size]] [/B] [/scan] [/spotfix]
  volume              Specifies the drive letter (followed by a colon),
                      mount point, or volume name.
  filename            FAT/FAT32 only: Specifies the files to check for
                      fragmentation.
  /F                  Fixes errors on the disk.
  /V                  On FAT/FAT32: Displays the full path and name of every
                      file on the disk.
                      On NTFS: Displays cleanup messages if any.
  /R                  Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information
                      (implies /F, when /scan not specified).
  /L:size             NTFS only:  Changes the log file size to the specified
                      number of kilobytes.  If size is not specified, displays
                      current size.
  /X                  Forces the volume to dismount first if necessary.
                      All opened handles to the volume would then be invalid
                      (implies /F).
  /I                  NTFS only: Performs a less vigorous check of index
                      entries.
  /C                  NTFS only: Skips checking of cycles within the folder
                      structure.
  /B                  NTFS only: Re-evaluates bad clusters on the volume
                      (implies /R)
  /scan               NTFS only: Runs an online scan on the volume
  /forceofflinefix    NTFS only: (Must be used with "/scan")
                      Bypass all online repair; all defects found
                      are queued for offline repair (i.e. "chkdsk /spotfix").
  /perf               NTFS only: (Must be used with "/scan")
                      Uses more system resources to complete a scan as fast as
                      possible. This may have a negative performance impact on
                      other tasks running on the system.
  /spotfix            NTFS only: Runs spot fixing on the volume
  /sdcleanup          NTFS only: Garbage collect unneeded security descriptor
                      data (implies /F).
  /offlinescanandfix  Runs an offline scan and fix on the volume.
  /freeorphanedchains FAT/FAT32/exFAT only: Frees any orphaned cluster chains
                      instead of recovering their contents.
  /markclean          FAT/FAT32/exFAT only: Marks the volume clean if no
                      corruption was detected, even if /F was not specified.
The /I or /C switch reduces the amount of time required to run Chkdsk by
skipping certain checks of the volume.
To check the current disk, type CHKDSK with no parameters.

  /M           Copies only files with the archive attribute set,
               turns off the archive attribute.
  /D:m-d-y     Copies files changed on or after the specified date.
               If no date is given, copies only those files whose
               source time is newer than the destination time.
  /EXCLUDE:file1[+file2][+file3]...
               Specifies a list of files containing strings.  Each string
               should be in a separate line in the files.  When any of the
               strings match any part of the absolute path of the file to be
               copied, that file will be excluded from being copied.  For
               example, specifying a string like \obj\ or .obj will exclude
               all files underneath the directory obj or all files with the
               .obj extension respectively.

  /W           Prompts you to press a key before copying.
  /C           Continues copying even if errors occur.
  /I           If destination does not exist and copying more than one file,
               assumes that destination must be a directory.
  /-I          If destination does not exist and copying a single specified file,
               assumes that destination must be a file.
  /Q           Does not display file names while copying.
  /F           Displays full source and destination file names while copying.
  /L           Displays files that would be copied.
  /G           Allows the copying of encrypted files to destination that does
               not support encryption.
  /H           Copies hidden and system files also.
  /R           Overwrites read-only files.
  /T           Creates directory structure, but does not copy files. Does not
               include empty directories or subdirectories. /T /E includes
               empty directories and subdirectories.
  /U           Copies only files that already exist in destination.
  /K           Copies attributes. Normal Xcopy will reset read-only attributes.

Attempts to diagnose heavily damaged ReFS volumes, identify remaining files,
and copy those files to another volume.
ReFS Salvage has a Scan Phase and a Copy Phase.  In automatic mode, the Scan
Phase and Copy Phase will run sequentially.  In manual mode, each phase can be
run separately.  Progress and logs are saved in a working directory to allow
phases to be run separately as well as Scan Phase to be paused and resumed.
Here are the automatic mode Command Line Usages:
Quick Automatic Mode Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -QA <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>
   It will perform a Quick Scan Phase followed by a Copy Phase.
   This mode runs quicker as it assumes some critical structures of the volume
   are not corrupted and so there is no need to scan the entire volume to
   locate them.  This also reduces the recovery of stale files/directories/volumes.
Full Automatic Mode Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -FA <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>
   It will perform a Full Scan Phase followed by a Copy Phase.
   This mode may take a long time as it will scan the entire volume for any
   recoverable files/directories/volumes.
Here are the manual mode Command Line Usages:
Diagnose Phase Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -D <source volume> <working directory> <options>
   Attempt to determine if <source volume> is an ReFS volume and determine
   if the volume is mountable. When a volume is not-mountable, reason(s) will
   be determined.  This is a standalone phase.
Quick Scan Phase Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -QS <source volume> <working directory> <options>
   Quick Scan <source volume> for any recoverable files.
   This mode runs quicker as it assumes some critical structures of the volume
   are not corrupted and so there is no need to scan the entire volume to
   locate them.  This also reduces the recovery of stale files/directories/volumes.
   Discovered files will be logged to "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" under
   <working directory>.  If the Scan Phase was previously stopped, running with
   the -QS flag again will resume the scan from where it left off.
Full Scan Phase Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -FS <source volume> <working directory> <options>
   Scan entire <source volume> for any recoverable files.
   This mode may take a long time as it will scan the entire volume for any
   recoverable files.
   Discovered files will be logged to "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" under
   <working directory>.  If the Scan Phase was previously stopped, running with
   the -FS flag again will resume the scan from where it left off.
Copy Phase Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -C <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>
   Copy all files described in "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" to
   <target directory>.  If Scan Phase is stopped too early,
   "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" may not have been written yet and so no file
   will be copied to <target directory>.
Copy Phase with List Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -SL <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <file list> <options>
   Copy all the files in <file list> from <source volume> to <target directory>.
   The files in <file list> must have first been identified by the Scan Phase
   though the scan need not have been run to completion.
   <file list> can be generated by copying "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt"
   to a new file, removing lines referencing files that shouldn't be restored,
   and preserving files that should be restored.  The PowerShell cmdlet
   Select-String may be helpful in filtering "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt"
   to only include desired paths, extensions, or file names.
Copy Phase with Interactive Console:
   refsutil salvage -IC <source volume> <working directory> <options>
   Salvage files in an interactive console for advanced users.
   This mode also requires files generated from either of the Scan Phases.
Parameter definitions:
<source volume>         ReFS volume to process. Drive letter in format "L:",
                        or a path to the volume mount point.
<working directory>     Location to store temporary information and logs.
                        It must not be located on <source volume>.
<target directory>      Location where identified files will be copied to.
                        It must not be located on <source volume>.
<options>
   -m                   Recover all possible files including deleted ones.
                        This option will be ignored on refsutil salvage v1.
                        WARNING: Not only this will take longer time to run,
                        it can lead to unexpected result.
   -v                   Verbose mode

---- Leak Detection and Fixing ----
Usage: refsutil leak <drive> [/a] [/x] [/v] [/d] [/q] [/t <count>] [/s <file>]
/a          If leak detection finds a corruption, setting this switch attempt to fix it and re-run leak
            detection. With this switch set leak detection will be restarted once for every corrupted
            directory found on the volume.
/x          Operate holding an exclusive lock on the volume. Without this switch leak detection will
            create a snapshot of the volume for processing.
/v          Verbose output.
/d          Diagnose only. Leaks will be printed to stdout, but not fixed.
/q          Query required space for operation.
/t <count>  Number of threads to spawn for leak detection. Specifying a value of 0 will run leak detection
            synchronously (this is not recommended). Default is 4.
/s <file>   Run operation using <file> as a scratch buffer. <file> must be able to grow to the value
            reported by /q. Ommision of this switch will create a scratch buffer in %TEMP%.
