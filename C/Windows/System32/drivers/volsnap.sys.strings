The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to keep disk space usage for shadow copies of volume %2 below the user defined limit.
The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to keep the total number of shadow copies of volume %2 below a limit.
Volume %2 is being reverted to the state of a previous shadow copy.
The reverting of volume %2 is being restarted.  This is most likely because of a system shutdown or a system crash.
The reverting of volume %2 to the state of a previous shadow copy is complete.
The oldest shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted to allow shadow copies created afterward and marked for delete to be deleted.
Error
Warning
Information
There was insufficient disk space on volume %3 to grow the shadow copy storage for shadow copies of %2.  As a result of this failure all shadow copies of volume %2 are at risk of being deleted.
An unfinished create of a shadow copy of volume %2 was deleted.
There was a user imposed limit that prevented disk space on volume %3 from being used to grow the shadow copy storage for shadow copies of %2.  As a result of this failure all shadow copies of volume %2 are at risk of being deleted.
The revert operation on volume %2 encountered a bad sector error.  Please validate the data on this volume.
The revert operation on volume %2 stopped because of the loss of a volume.  When the volume is re-introduced, the revert will continue.  You may have to reboot to trigger the revert.

In case of an error this scan is not performed.  The error may have originated in storage drivers beneath the volume snapshot driver; check their logs.%n%nIf the error is STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED this means the volume is in snapshot protection mode and has been taken offline to prevent loss of snapshots.

Some snapshots may be marked 'visible', meaning they were exposed as a local volume or file share.  Some detected snapshots may be marked 'deleted', meaning they are no longer available for use and their diff area space will be reclaimed when all older snapshots are deleted.  Look for instances of event 106 to see each snapshot that was discovered and whether it was 'visible' or 'deleted'.%n%nYou should expect this event when a volume is brought online or reverted to a snapshot.

The diff area for earlier persistent snapshots is typically read the first time the snapshot is read from.%n%nYou should expect this event when a volume is brought online, reverted to a snapshot, or when reading from a persistent snapshot for the first time after bringing a volume online.  This event may also occur if a volume is dismounted that contains snapshots that have not been read since the volume was brought online.  No user action is required.

A failure during this process results in loss of all snapshots whose diff area files are located on the volume, unless those snapshots are of volumes that are in snapshot protection mode.
The volume is preparing to be taken offline.%n%nVolume GUID: %1%n%nGuidance:%nSome system services, such as the cluster service, inform the volume snapshot driver when they are about to take the volume offline.%n%nYou should expect this event when an entity such as the cluster service prepares to take a volume offline.  No user action is required.
The volume snapshot driver has begun processing for dismount.%n%nVolume GUID: %1%n%nGuidance:%nWhen a volume is dismounted, the volume snapshot driver closes any handles it may have open on the dismounting volume, such as handles to diff areas.  All auto-release snapshots that have diff areas on the dismounting volume are deleted at this time. The volume snapshot driver may also perform some work to detect whether any future direct writes to the volume are to diff area space for persistent snapshots.  If such writes occur this detection work allows the volume snapshot driver to destroy the snapshots, since the direct volume writes may corrupt them.%n%nYou should expect this event when a volume dismounts.  No user action is required.

This process took longer than the amount of time allowed on this system, so activation has been aborted.  Unless the volume is in snapshot protection mode, all snapshots on this volume have been deleted.
The volume snapshot driver was unable to log an event to the legacy System event log.%n%nVolume Name: %2%nDiff Volume Name (if applicable): %4%nOriginal Error Event Code: %5%nOriginal Error Status: %6%nCause of Logging Failure:%10

This process attempts to determine whether the volume is part of a cluster shared resource, but the query to determine this failed.%n%nThis error does not indicate that any snapshots have been deleted.  You should expect this event if the volume is on a dynamic disk or is managed by a third-party volume manager.
Persistent snapshots are not supported on this edition of Windows.%n%nGuidance:%nThis edition of Windows does not support creation of persistent snapshots.  Autorelease snapshots are supported.

The shadow copy of volume %2 could not lock down the location of the shadow copy storage on volume %3.
The shadow copy of volume %2 could not be created due to insufficient resources for worker threads.

The flush and hold writes operation on volume %2 timed out while waiting for a release writes command.
The flush and hold writes operation on volume %2 timed out while waiting for file system cleanup.
The shadow copy of volume %2 took too long to install.
The shadow copy of volume %2 could not grow its shadow copy storage on volume %3.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because of an IO failure on volume %3.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because of insufficient paged heap.

An attempt to flush and hold writes on volume %2 was attempted while another flush and hold was already in progress.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because of a failed free space computation.
The flush and hold operation for volume %2 was aborted because of low available system memory.
The shadow copy storage volume specified for shadow copies on volume %2 could not be added.
There was insufficient disk space on volume %3 to create the shadow copy of volume %2.  Shadow copy storage creation failed.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were deleted because the shadow copy storage could not grow in time.  Consider reducing the IO load on the system or choose a shadow copy storage volume that is not being shadow copied.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted during detection because a critical control file could not be opened.
The shadow copy of volume %2 could not be created due to a failure in creating the necessary on disk structures.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted during detection.
A control item for shadow copies of volume %2 was lost during detection.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because the shadow copy storage volume was not present.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because the shadow copy storage failed to grow.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because the shadow copy storage could not grow due to a user imposed limit.
When preparing a new volume shadow copy for volume %2, the shadow copy storage on volume %3 could not be located in non-critical space.  Consider using a shadow copy storage volume that does not have any shadow copies.
The shadow copies of volume %2 were aborted because volume %3 has been dismounted.
When preparing a new volume shadow copy for volume %2, the shadow copy storage on volume %3 did not have sufficiently large contiguous blocks.  Consider deleting unnecessary files on the shadow copy storage volume or use a different shadow copy storage volume.
