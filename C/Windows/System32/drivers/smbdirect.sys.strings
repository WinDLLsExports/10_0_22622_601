The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per receive queue work request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per receive queue work request.
The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per send queue work request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per send queue work request.
The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per RDMA read request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per RDMA read request.
Setting %1\%2 is invalid. Verify that %2 is a DWORD (32-bit) value in the range %3 to %4 (inclusive). The default value of %5 will be used for this setting until the error is corrected.
The network adapter '%1' does not support a value of %4 for setting %2\%3. The closest adapter supported value of %5 will be used.
A connection has been terminated because no pending requests to network adapter '%6' have completed in the last %7 milliseconds. Verify that the network is operational and that the peer is responsive. This event may also indicate that there are insufficient send credits to support the workload. Socket = %1 Local = %3 Remote = %5
Settings BaseAffinityNode and MaxAffinityNode (\Registry\Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SMBDirect\Parameters) must specify a set of NUMA nodes that contain active processors. All of the system's processors will be eligible to perform SMB Direct processing until the error is corrected.
A registry configuration parameter is invalid.%n%nRegistryKey: %1%nParamName: %2%nParamType: %3%nMinValue: %4%nMaxValue: %5%nDefaultValue: %6%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator set an invalid configuration parameter value in the registry. Verify that the registry value is of the specified type and is in the range [MinValue, MaxValue]. The parameter's default value will be used until this issue is corrected. The SMB Direct driver must be restarted for the correction to take effect.
Loaded a registry configuration parameter value.%n%nRegistryKey: %1%nParamName: %2%nParamValue: %3%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that an administrator has overridden SMB Direct's default value for this configuration parameter.
The network adapter's FRMR page count is incompatible with SMB Direct.%n%nAdapterAlias: %1%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis network adapter reported an FRMR page count of zero, indicating that it does not support Fast Register Memory Regions (FRMRs). Compatible network adapters are required to support FRMRs. SMB Direct cannot be used with this network adapter.
Found an interrupt processor.%n%nNumaNode=%1%nProcessorGroup=%2%nProcessorMask=%3%nProcessorIndex=%4%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that SMB Direct found a processor it can use to process interrupts. This event is informational. No action is required.
A NUMA node has only one processor that may be used to process interrupts.%n%nNumaNode=%1%nProcessorGroup=%2%n%nGuidance:%n%nThis event indicates that SMB Direct found a NUMA node with only one processor that may be used to process interrupts. This configuration will degrade the performance of any SMB Direct connections that are affinitized to this NUMA node. It is recommended to increase the number of available processors in this NUMA node by changing the BaseAffinityProcessor and/or MaxAffinityProcessor configuration parameters.

SMB Direct Connection
SMB Direct Connection
The SMB Direct Connection performance counter set consists of counters that measure connection activity. A computer can have multiple SMB Direct connections. The SMB Direct Connection counter set represents each connection as a pair of IP addresses and ports, where the first IP address/port represents the connection's local endpoint and the second IP address/port represents the connection's remote endpoint.
Stalls (Send Credit)/sec
Stalls (Send Credit)/sec
Stalls (Send Credit)/sec is the rate at which transmission of SMB Direct packets stalled due to an insufficient number of send credits. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Stalls (Send Queue)/sec
Stalls (Send Queue)/sec
Stalls (Send Queue Capacity)/sec is the rate at which RDMA network interface requests stalled due to insufficient send queue capacity. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Stalls (RDMA Registrations)/sec
Stalls (RDMA Registrations)/sec
Stalls (RDMA Registrations Resources/sec) is the rate of memory registration stalls due to insufficient RDMA registration resources. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Sends/sec
Sends/sec
Sends/sec is the rate at which SMB Direct data packets are being sent to the peer. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Remote Invalidations/sec
Remote Invalidations/sec
Remote Invalidations/sec is the rate at which local RDMA registrations are being remotely invalidated by the peer. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Memory Regions
Memory Regions}Memory Regions is the number of memory regions that are currently allocated to this connection from the RDMA network adapter.
Bytes Received/sec
Bytes Received/sec
Bytes Received/sec is the rate at which data is being received from the peer. Data that is directly read from the peer via RDMA read operations is not counted. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Bytes Sent/sec
Bytes Sent/sec
Bytes Sent/sec is the rate at which data is being sent to the peer. Data that is directly written to the peer via RDMA write operations is not counted. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Bytes RDMA Read/sec
Bytes RDMA Read/sec
Bytes RDMA Read/sec is the rate at which bytes are being transferred by RDMA read operations. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Bytes RDMA Written/sec
Bytes RDMA Written/sec
Bytes RDMA Written/sec is the rate at which bytes are being transferred by RDMA write operations. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Stalls (RDMA Read)/sec
Stalls (RDMA Read)/sec
Stalls (RDMA Read)/sec is the rate at which RDMA reads stalled due to a limit on the number of simultaneous RDMA read operations per connection. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Receives/sec
Receives/sec
Receives/sec is the rate at which SMB Direct data packets are being received from the peer. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
RDMA Registrations/sec
RDMA Registrations/sec
RDMA Registrations/sec is the rate at which memory is being registered as the source or destination for an RDMA data transfer. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
SCQ Notification Events/sec
SCQ Notification Events/sec
SCQ Notification Events/sec is the rate at which SMB Direct is being notified that SQ work requests have completed to the SCQ. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
RCQ Notification Events/sec
RCQ Notification Events/sec
RCQ Notification Events/sec is the rate at which SMB Direct is being notified that RQ work requests have completed to the RCQ. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
 Spurious RCQ Notification Events Spurious RCQ Notification Events
Spurious RCQ Notification Events is the number of times SMB Direct has been notified that RQ work requests have completed to the socket's RCQ but found no CQEs to process. A non-zero count indicates a bug in the NDK provider.
 Spurious SCQ Notification Events Spurious SCQ Notification Events
Spurious SCQ Notification Events is the number of times SMB Direct has been notified that SQ work requests have completed to the socket's SCQ but found no CQEs to process. A non-zero count indicates a bug in the NDK provider.
