The following UTIL commands are available:
/UTIL /SETIEPROXY <account> <usage> [/CONN <connection name>]     
  Sets the Internet proxy settings for the <account> system account.
  Settings are applied to the default network connection, unless 
  <connection name> is specified.
   account choices:
    LOCALSYSTEM
    NETWORKSERVICE
    LOCALSERVICE
   usage choices:
    NO_PROXY     - Specify direct connection (no proxy server).
    AUTODETECT   - Turn on autodetection of proxy.
    MANUAL_PROXY - Use an explicit proxy list and bypass list. 
                   Must be followed by a proxy list and a proxy bypass list.
                   NULL or "" may be used for an empty proxy bypass list.
    AUTOSCRIPT   - Specify a script to be executed during proxy auto discovery.
                   Must be followed by a script URL.
   connection name indicates the network connection for which the new proxy 
   settings should be applied. If not specified, the default connection will 
   be used (usually the LAN connection). To get a list of possible connection
   names, use /CONN /?.
  Examples:
    bitsadmin /util /setieproxy localsystem AUTODETECT
    bitsadmin /util /setieproxy networkservice NO_PROXY
    bitsadmin /util /setieproxy localsystem MANUAL_PROXY proxy1:80 "<local>"
    bitsadmin /util /setieproxy localsystem MANUAL_PROXY pxy1,pxy2,pxy3 NULL
    bitsadmin /util /setieproxy networkservice AUTOSCRIPT http://server/get.asp
    bitsadmin /util /setieproxy networkservice NO_PROXY /CONN "XYZ Dialup"
/UTIL /GETIEPROXY <account> [/CONN <connection name>]
  Retrieves the Internet proxy settings for the <account> system
  account. Settings refer to the default network connection, unless 
  <connection name> is specified.
   account choices:
    LOCALSYSTEM
    NETWORKSERVICE
    LOCALSERVICE
   connection name indicates the network connection for which the new proxy
   settings should be applied. If not specified, the default connection 
   will be used (usually the LAN connection). To get a list of possible 
   connection names, use /CONN /?.
/UTIL /VERSION [/VERBOSE]
   Displays the version of BITS currently active on the system.
   The switch /VERBOSE prints additional information useful for 
   troubleshooting purposes.
/UTIL /ENABLEANALYTICCHANNEL TRUE/FALSE
   Enables/Disables the BITS Client Analytic channel
Note that the /SETIEPROXY and /ENABLEANALYTICCHANNEL commands require
administrator privileges.

The following commands are available:
/HELP           Prints this help 
/?              Prints this help 
/UTIL /?        Prints the list of utilities commands 
/PEERCACHING /?   Prints the list of commands to manage Peercaching
/CACHE /?       Prints the list of cache management commands 
/PEERS /?       Prints the list of peer management commands
/LIST    [/ALLUSERS] [/VERBOSE]     List the jobs
/MONITOR [/ALLUSERS] [/REFRESH sec] Monitors the copy manager
/RESET   [/ALLUSERS]                Deletes all jobs in the manager
/TRANSFER <job name> [type] [/PRIORITY priority] [/ACLFLAGS flags] [/DYNAMIC] 
          remote_url local_name
    Transfers one of more files.
    [type] may be /DOWNLOAD or /UPLOAD; default is download
    Multiple URL/file pairs may be specified.
    Unlike most commands, <job name> may only be a name and not a GUID.
    /DYNAMIC configures the job with BITS_JOB_PROPERTY_DYNAMIC_CONTENT, which relaxes the server-side requirements.
/CREATE [type] <job name>               Creates a job
    [type] may be /DOWNLOAD, /UPLOAD, or /UPLOAD-REPLY; default is download
    Unlike most commands, <job name> may only be a name and not a GUID.
/INFO <job> [/VERBOSE]                   Displays information about the job
/ADDFILE <job> <remote_url> <local_name> Adds a file to the job
/ADDFILESET <job> <textfile>             Adds multiple files to the job
   Each line of <textfile> lists a file's remote name and local name, separated
   by spaces.  A line beginning with '#' is treated as a comment.
   Once the file set is read into memory, the contents are added to the job.
/ADDFILEWITHRANGES  <job> <remote_url> <local_name range_list>
   Like /ADDFILE, but BITS will read only selected byte ranges of the URL.
   range_list is a comma-delimited series of offset and length pairs.
   For example,
       0:100,2000:100,5000:eof
   instructs BITS to read 100 bytes starting at offset zero, 100 bytes starting
   at offset 2000, and the remainder of the URL starting at offset 5000.
/REPLACEREMOTEPREFIX <job> <old_prefix> <new_prefix>
    All files whose URL begins with <old_prefix> are changed to use <new_prefix>
Note that BITS currently supports HTTP/HTTPS downloads and uploads.
It also supports UNC paths and file:// paths as URLS
/LISTFILES <job>                     Lists the files in the job
/SUSPEND <job>                       Suspends the job

/GETPEERSTATS <job> <file-index> 
    <file-index> starts from 0 
    Reports statistics about the amount of data downloaded from peers and origin servers for a specific file within a job.
The following options can be placed before the command:
/RAWRETURN                     Return data more suitable for parsing
/WRAP                          Wrap output around console (default)
/NOWRAP                        Don't wrap output around console
The /RAWRETURN option strips new line characters and formatting.
It is recognized by the /CREATE and /GET* commands.
Commands that take a <job> parameter will accept either a job name or a job ID
GUID inside braces.  BITSADMIN reports an error if a name is ambiguous.
