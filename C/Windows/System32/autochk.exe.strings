Autochk cannot lock system volume due to a sharing violation.
This is caused by a driver holding a file opened for write access.
Check all newly added driver NtCreateFile and NtOpenFile calls or run:
       !FindAutochkBlockers
From "kd" to list the files which may be preventing autochk from running.

  /DAX[:state]    NTFS Only: Enable direct access storage (DAX) mode for this
                  volume.  In DAX mode, the volume is accessed via the memory
                  bus, boosting IO performance.  A volume can be formatted
                  with DAX mode only if the hardware is DAX capable.
                  State can specify "enable" or "disable".  /DAX is considered

DAX support.
  /LogSize[:size] NTFS Only: Specifies the size for NTFS log file in kilobytes.
                  The minimum supported size is 2MB, so specifying size smaller
                  than 2MB will result in a 2MB log file.  Zero indicates the
                  default value which generally depend on the volume size.

Cannot locate or create an NTFS index.
This volume cannot be converted to %1.
Possible causes are:
    1.- Bad sectors in required areas of the volume.
    2.- %2 structures in areas required by %1.
Convert cannot gain exclusive access to the %1 drive,
so it cannot convert it now.  Would you like to
schedule it to be converted the next time the
system restarts (Y/N)? %0
The %1 file system is not enabled.  The volume
will not be converted.
Unsupported sector size.  Cannot convert volume to %1.
The file system has been converted.
Please wait while the system restarts.
The specified drive is the system partition on an ARC-compliant
system; its file system cannot be converted
The disk geometry recorded in the volume's Bios Parameter
Block differs from the geometry reported by the driver.
This volume cannot be converted to %1.
Name table translation is not available for conversion to %1.
The volume is too fragmented to be converted to NTFS.
Cannot find the utility library which contains CHKDSK for the
%1 file system. This volume cannot be converted to %2.
%1 cannot be converted because it contains files or directories
with reserved NTFS names in the root directory. There can be no
files or directories named $Mft, $MftMirr, $LogFile, $Volume,
$AttrDef, $BitMap, $Boot, $BadClus, $Secure, $UpCase, $Extend
or $Quota in the root directory.
This drive is dirty and cannot be converted. You will need to
clear the dirty bit on this drive by running CHKDSK /F or allowing
AUTOCHK to run on it the next time you reboot.
The file %1 specified to the /CvtArea option cannot be found at the root.
The file %1 specified to the /CvtArea option must be in one contiguous block.
The name %1 specified to the /CvtArea option must be a file name.
Convert cannot run because the volume is in use by another
process.  Convert may run if this volume is dismounted first.
ALL OPENED HANDLES TO THIS VOLUME WOULD THEN BE INVALID.
Would you like to force a dismount on this volume? (Y/N) %0
Convert failed to dismount the volume.

Attempts to diagnose heavily damaged ReFS volumes, identify remaining files,
and copy those files to another volume.
ReFS Salvage has a Scan Phase and a Copy Phase.  In automatic mode, the Scan
Phase and Copy Phase will run sequentially.  In manual mode, each phase can be
run separately.  Progress and logs are saved in a working directory to allow
phases to be run separately as well as Scan Phase to be paused and resumed.
Here are the automatic mode Command Line Usages:
Quick Automatic Mode Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -QA <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>
   It will perform a Quick Scan Phase followed by a Copy Phase.
   This mode runs quicker as it assumes some critical structures of the volume
   are not corrupted and so there is no need to scan the entire volume to
   locate them.  This also reduces the recovery of stale files/directories/volumes.
Full Automatic Mode Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -FA <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>
   It will perform a Full Scan Phase followed by a Copy Phase.
   This mode may take a long time as it will scan the entire volume for any
   recoverable files/directories/volumes.
Here are the manual mode Command Line Usages:
Diagnose Phase Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -D <source volume> <working directory> <options>
   Attempt to determine if <source volume> is an ReFS volume and determine
   if the volume is mountable. When a volume is not-mountable, reason(s) will
   be determined.  This is a standalone phase.
Quick Scan Phase Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -QS <source volume> <working directory> <options>
   Quick Scan <source volume> for any recoverable files.
   This mode runs quicker as it assumes some critical structures of the volume
   are not corrupted and so there is no need to scan the entire volume to
   locate them.  This also reduces the recovery of stale files/directories/volumes.
   Discovered files will be logged to "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" under
   <working directory>.  If the Scan Phase was previously stopped, running with
   the -QS flag again will resume the scan from where it left off.
Full Scan Phase Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -FS <source volume> <working directory> <options>
   Scan entire <source volume> for any recoverable files.
   This mode may take a long time as it will scan the entire volume for any
   recoverable files.
   Discovered files will be logged to "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" under
   <working directory>.  If the Scan Phase was previously stopped, running with
   the -FS flag again will resume the scan from where it left off.
Copy Phase Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -C <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <options>
   Copy all files described in "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" to
   <target directory>.  If Scan Phase is stopped too early,
   "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt" may not have been written yet and so no file
   will be copied to <target directory>.
Copy Phase with List Command Line Usage:
   refsutil salvage -SL <source volume> <working directory> <target directory> <file list> <options>
   Copy all the files in <file list> from <source volume> to <target directory>.
   The files in <file list> must have first been identified by the Scan Phase
   though the scan need not have been run to completion.
   <file list> can be generated by copying "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt"
   to a new file, removing lines referencing files that shouldn't be restored,
   and preserving files that should be restored.  The PowerShell cmdlet
   Select-String may be helpful in filtering "foundfiles.<volume signature>.txt"

---- Commands Supported ----
fixboot   Repair boot sectors
leak      Leak Detection and Fixing
salvage   Salvage operations for corrupt volume
triage    Handle corruptions
---- Leak Detection and Fixing ----
Usage: refsutil leak <drive> [/a] [/x] [/v] [/d] [/q] [/t <count>] [/s <file>]
/a          If leak detection finds a corruption, setting this switch attempt to fix it and re-run leak
            detection. With this switch set leak detection will be restarted once for every corrupted
            directory found on the volume.
/x          Operate holding an exclusive lock on the volume. Without this switch leak detection will
            create a snapshot of the volume for processing.
/v          Verbose output.
/d          Diagnose only. Leaks will be printed to stdout, but not fixed.
/q          Query required space for operation.
/t <count>  Number of threads to spawn for leak detection. Specifying a value of 0 will run leak detection
            synchronously (this is not recommended). Default is 4.
/s <file>   Run operation using <file> as a scratch buffer. <file> must be able to grow to the value
            reported by /q. Ommision of this switch will create a scratch buffer in %TEMP%.
<drive>     Drive letter in format "L:", or a path to the volume mount point.
Note that providing /d alongside /a will triage all found directory/file corruptions, but will not fix leaks.
Eg: refsutil leak D: /a /t 4 /s R:\scratch.tmp
Eg: refsutil leak D: /a /d /v /t 4
Eg: refsutil leak D: /q

Scrubbing file "%1!s!"
---- Triage and corruption handling ----
Usage: refsutil triage <drive> [/s <id>] [/g] [/v]
/s <id>     Scrub the directory corresponding to <id>. <id> Is the file id for the directory. This
            will scrub all files under the given directory. It can not be used together with /g
            option.
/g          Scrub the global tables of the volume. It can not be used together with /s <id> option.
/v          Verbose output.
<drive>     Drive letter in format "L:", or a path to the volume mount point.
Eg: refsutil triage D: /s 15100
Eg: refsutil triage D: /s 16040 /v
The file "%1!s!" was correctly scrubbed.
Triage has completed succesfully.
WARNING: THIS OPERATION CHANGES BOOT SECTOR(S) OF A VOLUME AND CAN RESULT IN TOTAL LOSS OF DATA.
Usage: refsutil fixboot <drive> <MajorVersion> <MinorVersion> <ClusterSize> [-f] [-w <Dir>] [-smr] [-x]
<drive>         Drive letter in format "L:".
<MajorVersion>  Major version of the ReFS volume.
<MinorVersion>  Minor version of the ReFS volume.
<ClusterSize>   Cluster size of the volume.  Either 4096 or 65536.
-f              Ignore any valid boot sector found.  Fix boot sector based on input parameters.
-w <Dir>        Actually write to the boot sector(s) if needed and backup the current boot sector(s)
                into the backup directory <Dir>.
-smr            Specifies this if volume is of SMR format.  Cluster size must be 65536.
-x              Force the volume to dismount first if necessary.  All opened handles to
                the volume would then be invalid.
